hi really need opinion only one trust very inspired vivo x200 ultra camera but unsure 35mm main lens used 24mm lens professional camera years not sure feel using 35mm time still understand importance image quality benefits 35mm considering 200 pro instead but no bloggers compare ultra pro directly tell much better ultra really would smarter go global version pro rather ultra chinese rom? choose pro worth paying extra global version chinese rom tweaks just good even better terms optimization quality?	2	2
please	1	1
went vivo x200 ultra might not bells whistles ultra camera but size really perfect	1	1
please compare iphone	1	1
