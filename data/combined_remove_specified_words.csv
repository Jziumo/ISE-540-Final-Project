description sounds like looks like copy shockwave 5 but ll give my try fyi though nike outsoles wear out way faster outdoor courts	1	1
hey man where did u get kind words cost nothing hoodie ur wearing video brother ?	2	2
hey weartesters! here s new idea how keep channel up running gain more subscribers start making videos revisiting sneakers ve reviewed past or recently mean another performance review after they ve been used several times s viewers learn how basketball shoes perform long term or after they ve been used many times! not just single reviews after tested them few games only or first time feet feeling basketball shoes perform differently after many uses	1	2
really like basketball shoes look feel like running shoes like series my style play ideal when seldom play outdoors fun kids wearing my running shoes always more comfort free but lacks support cushion gap filled built bballshoe if only upper close toes area wasn t kind square shape should been one piece connected rest upper very good design! not price though! only bargain buy these recycled synthetic materials all crap pay 190 ! thanks presentation!	2	2
these were going my wish list its been since t mac millennium since copped anything court but another torn acl retired me might still try pick them up if they ever hit discount but m sad wouldn t able put these their intended purpose	2	1
should put zoom stroble gt cut 3	1	1
sole similar material used lebron 17 s picks up dust easily need wiped every possession proper grip sole very grippy specially clean squeaky courts	2	2

just got my pair from retailer today s very interesting how my first reaction also damn these fun traction feels awesome rubber feels really sticky heel toe transition impeccable very smooth however would say court feel isn t great comparing ja 1s kyrie s kobe s cuz feels little high off ground cushioning feels new me doesn t compressive feeling zoom unit but rather feels soft there s visible grey pebax plate or whatever s called under rubber allows quick explosive comeback when do stuff like rocker step overall very interesting shoes! ps my opinion if buying ep versions should go down half size	2	2
want add these my rotation basketball rotation these lebron 20 kobe 4 serious player only	2	2
looks seems nice features but only zoomx over air zoom no go	1	1
played gt cut 3s 6 hours now they attract lot dust playing basketball super annoying if wipe after every other play maybe solid rubber will better? idk anyone had same experience? do they get better? thinking about returning them already lol	0	1

nice driving shots from bedford	2	2
when talking about car price 100 000 higher there no worth involved s not worth such cars just showoff luxury items snobs brag about their financial prowess these cars stupid high profit margin aka buyers being scammed value per dollar euro pound whatever currency spent very low even 50 000 car falls into category unless some new tech involved example tesla model 3 y where ask yourself worth buy model 3 or something else what do get money? if use various incentives from governments bring sales price down tax credit not how much benefits per dollar spent do get ?	1	1

unfortunately these cars very high car wanker ratio re mixing sporty audi electric smugness	0	0
am confused he said tech isn t great but what tech do want? feel like people always like oh tech good or bad but what does even mean? what people even talking about? nobody ever even says what they mean its like trigger word like sustainability like means something but doesn t had tesla an etron gt can tell etron gt monumentally nicer than tesla guess etron doesn t pointless games fart noise maker though ? what people mean by tech? only positive tesla range didn t need charging network	1	1
great review seems very versatile car	2	2
looks like very low tech basic ev maybe 40k reasonable price don t believe germans can sell evs they just too nostalgic extremely overpriced! they will fade away watch their ev sales numbers	1	1
thanks bro pretty timely informative length time sitting waiting recharge however dunno	2	2
no way worth 120k price new cars completely out control now after autumn budget looks like dacia will sell lot cars anyway look second hand values any audi hybrid or electric cars dropping like stones	2	2

hell no not worth can get used r8 half price not deal extra pain ass an electric car becomes when needs repaired why pay more more expensive fix car performes exact same an r 8 costs twice much? lol its def hard pass me f	0	0
actually like audi not going full into developing an entire infotainment system no matter what car produce s always case by end production system apps already outdated android ios apps moving lightspeed there no point racing against them simple android auto apple carplay more than enough they basically offering wireless displays which can connect phone car can t get any more personalized than	2	2
short answer yes	2	2
if can afford one can afford fuel go buy an rs7 no compromises	1	1
love review sir! owned 22 prem just below rs 22k miles from new s my daily driver m 6 5 all legs but find comfortable getting out such low car can tricky car solid but had some major recalls failures heater recall brakes repairs no recall there no over air software update think support dealership model force us back dealership software which crazy but get review some what matches my real life experiences frank honest but think he nip pic stuff just doesn t matter never had issue door handle pitching me agree not good if happens true there no good spot put phone put my ip floor or passenger seat phone charger compartment crappy over heats like other car due lack ventilation ip case too large not worth hassle use cable plugged into back seat tires pricey but can find reasonable options deprecation loss value hit real bad cost doing business degree wished had leased water up bridge point range better than audi advertise which better than not getting what advertised tech basic but not horrible mmi system could use some improvements repeatedly reset or acknowledge app updates love car but she ain t perfect would still take over any telsa model would still chose gt over taycan because external profile internal layout lack buttons	1	1

switched from apple ecosystem samsung having issues car play dropping issues connecting my daughter having same issues now am samsung android never had an issue now samsung watch s10 tablet all work together seamlessly plus once my s25 ultra everything set itself up haven t had any issues all my apple 15pro max ipad pro m4 13 didn t sync especially emails messages will never go back apple once apple stuck there much more flexibility android	2	2
carry both these phones am deep iphone ecosystem but samsung phone clearly better faster phone can take excellent photos iphone left dust by samsung	2	2
don t understand why youtubers compare iphones androids iphones don t sell their phones they sell ios their insane cameras shoot amazing videos see comparison pointless s25 ultra will beat iphone 16 pro all areas specification wise but iphone users don t see iphones s really important understand yes paper s25 ultra better phone but there other aspects where iphone beats s25 ultra m not saying those areas s25 ultra can t do well but there some things iphone just does better why do think all celebrities most content creators most filmmakers an iphone s because iphones just do social media better its more optimized videos iphones really nice not mention their phones running ios just different experience all together yes me if were pick between one them then will go s25 ultra but if heavy social media videography or had lot followers instagram will close my eyes go iphone	2	2
here am my pixel 7 hating how far behind google smartphones	2	2
believe assessment largely accurate however crucial category might overlooked service repair instance can get an apple device serviced about an hour m not certain if samsung can match level service nevertheless if chinese continue improve their current pace both samsung apple could potentially lose their positions world stage	1	1

iphone 16 pro max what m using feel secured every aspect tried s24 ultra but really am not secured confident while using s24 ultra m back apple iphone 16 pro max	1	1
spec wise s25 ultra better every way but iphone optimized ll par or just slightly slower than s25 ultra also if we talk about gaming iphone games feel more optimized also iphone get lot other things don t get s25 ultra best smart watch seamless airpods connection all its features seamless connection between iphone macbook if re editor editing macbook its no brainer using an iphone its all when comes iphones people s preference towards phone but yeah just solely talking about phone no phone world comes close beast itself powerhouse ultimate phone yes ofcourse m talking about s25 ultra	2	2
can t watch these sponsored fake review vids anymore!	0	0
way choose between 2 if prefer more productive go samsung s25 ultra if prefer more social media uploads then go iphone 16 pm	2	2
some nifty features overlooked comparison example very much useful ai very efficient s pen very helpful galaxy routine reverse charging !!! samsung made my life very easy tbh!	2	2
nothing compares ios most people too dumb understand design language tiny details but everything about ios just perfection they just get simple buy phone like but apple just kind design language they don t glue their camera rings	2	2
android 16 desktop mode will full linux thing	2	2

s25 ultra overheating camera lag camera lenses ring popping off removed bluetooth from s pen short battery life screen coating rubbing off dull screen all well documented samsung community website glad cancelled order hope s26 ultra does better! samsung needs better engineers their phone division indeed!	2	2
queria poder ter os dois hehehe both!	1	1
samsung does much larger ecosystem devices than think smart things app can literally control everything house way better than home kit can samsung laptop headphone tablet watch all working 1 ecosystem can then connect samsung tv control all sorts apps furthermore can also use google tv which works seamlessly samsung point being if bought into all samsung devices can live an apple free life	1	1
samsung got robbed mic quality test over video samsung sounded way clearer imo	2	1
m windows user s25 ultra overall better phone android windows work great together s25 ultra	2	2
just adding one more thing no phone world comes close overall performance s25 ultra except oneplus 13 its actually really close contender but still not better than s25 ultra yeah its just good can t do anything about	2	2
one aspect samsung ecosystem missed they also make appliances home theater samsung range can get notification when preheated my tv tablet watch phone if want	1	1
s25 ultra another level	1	1
ios not good android quality life features android just many more where even basic android phones features ios doesn t such back gestures clipboard notification history different sound level options no mentioning how many hours till alarm rings notification history makes pip maps amongst others	2	2
agree totally both phones do think samsung an overall better experience love buds pro 3 but use my iphone more since also airpod maxes macbook pro ipad pro an apple watch	2	2

chinese software good? specifically opppo oneplus	2	2
sad not global not supporting companies do	1	1
vivo should just throw funtouch into bin originos miles ahead even against hyperos coloros	1	1
hi really need opinion s only one trust m very inspired by vivo x200 ultra camera but m unsure about 35mm main lens m used 24mm lens my professional camera years m not sure how ll feel using 35mm all time still understand importance image quality benefits 35mm s why m considering 200 pro instead but no bloggers compare ultra pro directly can t tell how much better ultra really would smarter go global version pro rather than ultra chinese rom? if do choose pro worth paying extra global version or chinese rom some tweaks just good or even better terms optimization quality?	2	2
please	1	1
s why went vivo x200 ultra might not bells whistles ultra camera but size really perfect	1	1
please compare iphone	1	1
did any cellular issues using device? s my only concern	1	1
there any workaround wearos watches phone or not? some china rom phones can get working if not what smart watch could recommend replacing galaxy watch ultra	1	1
after some messing about able register vivo account my computer using my email address after able log my vivo phone take advantage extra features	1	1
see direction vivo going like it! their almost able use same sensor all three focal lengths! imagine day where lenses sensors get optimised point where they can use 1 inch sensors all them	1	1
we need go back having normal sized phones crazy creative designs aren t just giant white bricks giant bumpy circular camera lenses cover 50 back sure we do love having nice cameras but dont want cary camera also phone my pocket want phone also camera	2	2
think one those cases where calling camera island abso bloody lutely valid justified	1	1
we all just need global version	1	1
such shame its not going global release no wear os support no circle search means no way me	1	1

dog stinking cute!	1	2
thanks review appreciate capacity test numbers verify get what s being advertised m seeing lot anker prime knockoffs amazon 60 80 pricing thinking they can t actual mah capacity they touting lastly could start adding mention if each power bank supports pass through charging well one reason chose anker prime can run usb c device like new starlink mini while also charging maintaining anker prime power bank my foldable 45w solar panel	1	1
5 18 even dog wants stop!	2	2

5 19 let me subscribe feel good hand	2	2
am suprised anker 737 didnt make list	1	1
can please make video best solar powered bank charger too	1	2
remember fast charging shorter lifespan every reference read states maximize life battery keep power level between 20 90 try not go under do not charge 100 if want max battery output life 99 all power bank makers state capacity their pbs lets say 20 000mah actual output will between 10 20 less than 20 000mah stated 20 less output being norm batteries output 90 above simply understate actual capacity appears they more efficient batteries 20 000mah may 22 000mah actual capacity may appear 90 efficient more capacity more weight unless they fudged numbers also check pass through charging many makers do not build capability into their pbs cut manufacturing costs pass through charging means can charge pb device s connected pb simultaneously	1	1
love anker its reliable holds full charge even after 6 months	2	2
thought about adding uk affiliate links? ve spent couple 100 thanks	1	1
got new subscriber here! appreciate approach!	2	2

why not ugreen 145w 25 000mah?	1	1
what about shargeek 140? its best my opinion	2	2

think would rather put my money anker longevity safety who knows where ugreen assembled let alone durability	1	1
anyway can do solar powered version these please	1	1
quite an amateur review waste time guy obviously no idea about efficiency voltage difference let alone total power consumption	0	0
basically what need 1 fast charging power bank not too extreme like 100 watts but least 25 watts 2 pass through charging can charge power bank itself from wall socket but simultaneously charging phone too	1	1
dog waiting hurry up because he s hungry	1	1
all shhh sounds his words killing video man scrub audio before publishing people don t get lost all shhhh couldn t make while speaking	1	1

most people wouldn t drive more than 300 miles one day 45 min charge becomes less relevant imo because recharge overnight those who do sure ll take longer but not much might think by time factor food stops toilet breaks plus may not need charge 100 get destination overnight charge my experience tesla 3 driver currently my first 200 miles free from home solar but extra 100 miles sure very tempting	2	2
mach e gt performance can do 0 60 3 3 seconds just like model 3 but range less about 280 miles heard mach e more comfortable quieter also like mach e speedometer right front driver seat like every car other than tesla after watching many comparison videos placed an order 2025 mach e gt performance	2	2
fast charging now 80 30 35 minutes	2	2
forgot add 2024 ford mustang mach e will able charge tesla level 3 chargers nationwide lowering charge time	2	2
bought mach e two half years ago extended range battery but numbers wrong 76 000 dollars first s great car love extremely comfortable sit all features anyone could want said charging home an overnight affair won t use fast chargers because charge by time hooked up makes more expensive than gas while frunk nice never use area remains unseated during snow snow builds up while drive using one pedal drive causes rotors rust up from not being used then switch back normal drive pads rust combine destroy rotors could go about poor features but there s no time here while liked presentation don t all facts should dig deeper ll end evs not what they cranked up before buy one do homework let buyer beware dealers won t tell down sides politicians pursuing an agenda they lie our nations electric grid cannot handle load californians already being told not charge up home evs not ready prime time they only can last about 10 years max then need replace battery costs my case 37 000 gas car can last 20 years or more proper care not evs if people don t buy them manufacturers won t make them evs being pushed down our throats by lying scheming politicians includes our resident	2	2
evs fad just like they were 20 30 40 even 50 years ago they nothing new will not last gas cars can last longer drive longer distances while they good theory evs more dangerous environment lithium batteries which more dangerous environment than gas costs 3x much produce re not saving environment re actually killing x3	1	1
yeah top three requirements my next bev fast charge rate flat curve	2	2
don t get why labeled mustang when its 4 door crossover but seems decent ev they should make one thats 2 door coupe or convertible like mustangs always been previously	1	1
amazing looking car had mine 6 months nothing but amazing people regularly compliment looks drove many electric cars bought one soon sat many people seem comment without actually owning or driving one	2	2
bought my wife mach e gt love when we travel long distances we use gas vehicle but we hardly ever do had about 4 months drives charges seamlessly	2	2
