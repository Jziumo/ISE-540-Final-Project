thi vs lebron 21	1	1
glad nike got thi right	2	2
i love the look of these and the fact that they re not as narrow as the gt cut 2 but that price 190 for these seriously? oh well they just might be worth the money we ll see thank for anoth dope video from weartesters!	2	2
me after these arriv damnit nightw look what you made me do!	1	1
your descript sound like and it look like a copi of the shockwav 5 but i ll give the my a tri fyi though nike outsol wear out way faster on outdoor court	1	1
hey man where did u get that kind word cost noth hoodi ur wear in thi video brother ?	2	2
hey weartesters! here s a new idea on how to keep thi channel up and run and gain more subscrib start make video on revisit sneaker you ve review in the past or recent i mean anoth perform review after they ve been use sever time it s for viewer to learn how basketbal shoe perform in the long term or after they ve been use mani times! not just singl review after you test them for a few game onli or first time on feet feel basketbal shoe perform differ after mani use	1	2
i realli like basketbal shoe that look and feel like run shoe like thi seri for my style of play is ideal when i seldom play outdoor for fun with kid wear my run shoe is alway more comfort and free but lack of support and cushion that gap is fill with the built of thi bballsho if onli thi upper close to the toe area wasn t kind of squar shape it should have been one piec connect with the rest upper veri good design! not the price though! onli on bargain to buy these recycl synthet materi are all crap to pay for 190 ! thank for the presentation!	2	2
these were go to be on my wish list it been sinc the t mac millennium sinc i cop anyth for the court but anoth torn acl retir me i might still tri to pick them up if they ever hit discount but i m sad i wouldn t be abl to put these to their intend purpos	2	1
should put zoom strobl on gt cut 3	1	1
the sole is similar to the materi use on lebron 17 s pick up dust easili and need to be wipe everi possess to have a proper grip the sole is veri grippi special on clean squeaki court	2	2
can t wait to get them on court the cut 2 wa an aterthought and w the ankl slippag of that shoe dem super danger the cut 3 realli ha lot of potenti we shall see if you don t wipe your shoe are youreal a basketbal player realli got me lol	2	2
def improv over the 2 but at that price is it better then wow all citi 2	2	2
i ve been wait on thi review almost bought them on id4sho then i wa like nah nightw hasn t done the review yet lol	2	2
i love the first gt cut amaz and beauti shoe but thi one is kind of weird or ugli	0	0
those look sexi fr think they ll have the same bounc sensat as the jordan xxv low just softer judg from my invinc run 3 s that zoom x cannot be tame even if you cage it in it s hella bounci and soft	2	2
is the ep version wider?	1	1
got mine today at outlet for 69 when i tri it on whoooaahhh such a good feel im just a weekend warrior so i realli need a veri good cushion shoe	2	2
is the shoe mainli for indoor court or can it be use for outdoor courts?	1	2

fission 9 review when?	1	1
kill thi great job	2	2
love the messag on the hoodie! i ve been mean to grab a gt cut are these breathable? will you do a comparison video between these and the take down version?	1	2
just got my pair from a retail today it s veri interest how my first reaction wa also damn these are fun the traction feel awesom the rubber feel realli sticki and the heel to toe transit is impecc veri smooth howev i would say the court feel isn t that great compar to the ja 1s kyri s and kobe s cuz it feel a littl high off ground the cushion feel new to me it doesn t have the compress feel of a zoom unit but rather feel soft there s a visibl grey pebax plate or whatev it s call under the rubber and it allow you to have a quick explos comeback when you do stuff like the rocker step overal veri interest shoes! ps in my opinion if you are buy the ep version you should go down half a size	2	2
i want to add these to my rotat of basketbal rotat these lebron 20 kobe 4 and seriou player onli	2	2
look and seem with nice featur but onli zoomx over air zoom is a no go	1	1
i play in the gt cut 3s for 6 hour now and they attract a lot of dust play basketbal is super annoy if you have to wipe after everi other play mayb solid rubber will be better? idk ha anyon had the same experience? do they get better? think about return them alreadi lol	0	1
ani frame do we see the inner side of the shoe?	1	1
i m in the market for a run shoe last one i had wa a the lunar back in 2018 what s the follow up to that shoe?	1	1
they look like lebron 21	1	1
they definit look nice	2	2
these give me the same feel as the origin crazylight boost back in 2016 the cushion compar to other hoop shoe is next level haven t been thi excit about the introduct of new tech in a hoop shoe sinc then and have not been disappointed!	1	1
chines brand like li ning anta alreadi great at make basketbal shoe with supercrit midsol with carbon fiber plate nike is kinda late to do thi	2	2
we don t wipe sole in pr we just play in ani court	1	1
at least where i play here in brazil we don t usual wipe the traction and it s veri rare to see someon do it too and it s outdoors!	1	1
i got the miami vibe color way the fit feel great traction hand down	2	2
those are fire	1	1
look like a lebron first glanc	2	2
see mix initi impressions! ani date on us release?	1	1
of all the review you were the first one to prais the zoomx give me hope	2	2
i ve been say thi ever sinc i saw thi the shape of the midsol realli remind of me the jordan jumpman hustl	2	2
remind me of the old alpha project the line that kinda pioneer the way for the hyperfus line or someth the kick that had the transpar heel counter they came out around the time of the ultraposit flightposit 3s hyperdunk and vc shox i think gari payton wore them in la	1	1
i bought these for my son but bum they don t have a shank they fold in half so i m not sure they will have much energi return	1	1
weartest do these feel high off the ground? or feel like there could be stabil issues? i onli ask becaus the heel look high off the ground compar to the forefoot thank	2	2
whi did those leak photo of a differ shoe came out like a month ago ? they came out as gtcut 3s	1	1
how would you compar thi to ani of the kobe line? i ve been chase the kobe 5 6 feel	1	1
actual look good	2	2
imagin zoomx with zoom air in gt cut 4 mind blownnn	1	1
the 2s look better to me	1	1
my son ha both gt cut 3 and academi he love the academi and is a great valu but the gt cut 3 are in anoth level with comfort cushion and energi return	2	2
my comment would be can they make 3 4 or high top version like back in the day	2	2
i agre that thi should have been the successor to the first one appear wise the gt cut 2 look like it s from a branch timelin	2	2
those are the same design as the sabrina one	1	1
i wa just hope that they don t cage the zoom x foam becaus that s the most comfort nike foam	2	2
look like it is a winner for sure!	2	2
i wish the insol wa just a full length piec of zoom air i m excit to tri these been want zoomx in non runner ever sinc own the og invinc run	2	2
chang mine with red lace made it look like kobe grinch a bit	1	1

when you are talk about a car and a price of 100 000 and higher there is no worth involv it s not worth such car are just showoff luxuri item for the snob to brag about their financi prowess these car have a stupid high profit margin aka buyer are be scam as the valu per dollar euro pound whatev currenc spent is veri low even a 50 000 car fall into that categori unless it ha some new tech involv for exampl tesla model 3 y that is where you ask yourself is it worth to buy a model 3 or a someth els what do i get for that money? and if you use the variou incent from govern to bring the sale price down tax credit is not it how much benefit per dollar spent do i get ?	1	1
i see you re drive around bedford!	1	1
tri to increas resal value?? i respect your game	0	0
cours it s not worth it do you know of an electr vehicl that is not overpriced?	0	0
now that is a cool ev not the stupidli tall tesla everyon is buy these day love the red leather interior	2	2
can t get over the wonki tail light front end bumper from the new honda accord or civic taycan is a much better cohes design overal for 60k use may be worth it	1	2
they aren t worth the msrp the open market ha determin thi thi is one of the few car with huge manufactur discount becaus 1 year old car are worth approxim 50 of the new list price!! no joke i watch the wholesal market data just watch a 2022 sell for 95k cad with a new msrp over 200k!!!	1	1

unfortun these car have a veri high car to wanker ratio you re mix a sporti audi with electr smug	0	0
i am so confus he said the tech isn t great but what tech do you want? i feel like peopl are alway like oh the tech is good or bad but what doe that even mean? what are peopl even talk about? nobodi ever even say what they mean it like a trigger word like sustain like it mean someth but it doesn t i had a tesla and an etron gt and i can tell you that the etron gt wa monument nicer than the tesla i guess the etron doesn t have pointless game and a fart nois maker though ? is that what peopl mean by tech? the onli posit to tesla is rang i didn t need and the charg network	1	1
great review seem a veri versatil car	2	2
it look like a veri low tech basic ev mayb 40k is a reason price i don t believ german can sell ev they are just too nostalg and extrem overpriced! they will fade away watch their ev sale number	1	1
thank bro pretti time and inform the length of time sit wait on recharg howev i dunno	2	2
no way is it worth 120k the price of new car is complet out of control now after the autumn budget it look like dacia will sell a lot of car anyway look at the second hand valu of ani audi hybrid or electr car drop like stone	2	2
you are the best review on youtub so well done i got an e tron and i can t get more than 200 mile from a full charg but it not veri often i need more in a signal journey but it is a great car and so comfort i love to have a gt but not in my price rang	2	2
doe it have a button on a steer wheel? my a4 ha it and you can choos a function for that key by yourself i am use it for drive select	1	1
hell no not worth it you can get a use r8 for half the price and not deal with the extra pain in the ass an electr car becom when it need repair whi pay more for a more expens to fix car that perform the exact same as an r 8 that cost twice as much? lol it def a hard pass for me f that	0	0
i actual like audi not go full on into develop an entir infotain system no matter what car you produc it s alway the case that by the end of the product the system and the app on it are alreadi outdat android and io app are move at lightspe and there is no point of race against them simpl android auto and appl carplay is more than enough they are basic offer you wireless display to which you can connect your phone to your car it can t get ani more person than that	2	2
short answer ye	2	2
if you can afford one you can afford fuel so go buy an rs7 you have no compromis	1	1
love the review sir! have own a 22 prem just below rs for 22k mile from new it s my daili driver i m 6 5 and all leg but find it comfort get in out of such a low car can be tricki the car is solid but it ha had some major recal and failur heater recal brake repair no recal there is no over the air softwar updat i think to support the dealership model that forc us back to dealership for softwar which is crazi but i get it thi review some what match my is real life experi it frank and honest but i think he nip pic on stuff that just doesn t matter never had issu with door handl pitch me i agre not good if it happen true there is no good spot to put phone i put my ip on the floor or on passeng seat the phone charger in the compart is crappi over heat like other car due to lack of ventil ip in case is too larg and not worth hassl i use a cabl plug into back seat tire are pricey but you can find reason option deprec loss of valu hit is real and bad cost of do busi to a degre i wish i had leas water up the bridg at thi point rang is better than audi advertis which is better than not get what wa advertis tech is basic but not horribl the mmi system could use some improv you have to repeatedli reset or acknowledg app updat i love the car but she ain t perfect would still take it over ani telsa model i would still chose gt over taycan becaus of extern profil and intern layout lack of button	1	1

i switch from the appl ecosystem to samsung i wa have issu with car play drop and issu with connect my daughter is have the same issu now that i am with samsung and android i have never had an issu i now have the samsung watch and s10 tablet and all work togeth seamlessli plu onc my s25 ultra everyth set itself up and i haven t had ani issu at all my appl 15pro max and ipad pro m4 13 didn t sync especi with email and messag i will never go back to appl onc with appl you are stuck with it there is so much more flexibl with android	2	2
i carri both these phone i am deep in the iphon ecosystem but the samsung phone is clearli a better faster phone that can take excel photo iphon is left in the dust by samsung	2	2
i don t understand whi the youtub compar iphon and android iphon don t sell their phone they sell io and their insan camera that shoot amaz video see thi comparison is pointless the s25 ultra will beat iphon 16 pro in all the area specif wise but iphon user don t see that in iphon it s realli import to understand that ye on paper the s25 ultra is a better phone but there are other aspect where iphon beat the s25 ultra and i m not say that in those area the s25 ultra can t do well but there are some thing that the iphon just doe better whi do you think all the celebr most content creator and most filmmak have an iphon that s becaus iphon just do social media better it more optim video on the iphon are realli nice and not to mention their phone run on io is just a differ experi all togeth ye for me if i were to pick between one of them then i will go for the s25 ultra but if i wa heavi on social media and videographi or had a lot of follow on instagram i will close my eye and go for the iphon	2	2
here i am with my pixel 7 and hate how far behind googl is on smartphon	2	2
i believ your assess is larg accur howev a crucial categori you might have overlook is servic and repair for instanc i can get an appl devic servic in about an hour i m not certain if samsung can match thi level of servic nevertheless if the chines continu to improv at their current pace both samsung and appl could potenti lose their posit on the world stage	1	1
as a long time iphon user i m plan on switch to the pixel line when the 10 releas i ve own the pixel 2xl and it wa awesome! i did briefli consid the samsung line but i just can t get past one ui and the bloatwar	1	1

ain t no way you pick siri as the winner i follow the io sub on reddit and it s full of siri complaint all day everyday you should do an in depth video siri vs gemini in speed function and accuraci	1	0
first time here whi do you sound like a i ?	2	2
i start with iphon 4 all the way to appl x then i decid to switch to samsung becaus of 1 reason plan obsolesc by appl which i notic way back when i have my iphon 5 and i heard about it when i have my iphon x	1	1
ya no one like the camera control button i disabl it immedi it ruin thousand of case i can t stand it i almost want to downgrad just so it not there	0	0
i move to samsung after 20 year as iphon user and thi should make appl to wonder sinc they are lose also alsto the loyal custom and it is simpl samsung is realli much more ahead than appl appl arriv alway late than saumsung androind and the price they sell it is not fair anymor for what they realli offer you that s it	2	2

gemini s speed and voic recognit accuraci are still it biggest issu and no one s talk about em not even googl care	1	1
i like samsung i ve never had a iphon bc it wa alway so expens plu i don t use a lot of appl product so iphon compar isn t necessari	2	2

what i like on the iphon are face id haptic and most importantli the interfac	2	2
s25 ultra definit	2	2
buy a camera for a camera not a smart phone camera becaus over process photo yet take pictur with a camera and go into everi photo edit tool known to man to make it look good	2	2
im use s21 ultra and iphon 16 pro max but believ me my 4 year old samsung is way better then iphon 16 area like type dual screen spen bluetooth connect to ani devic without compromis sound qualiti which iphon reduc the sound qualiti if it s not connect to appl devic and the fun is use free app on android includ googl storag for free which appl want you to pay for everyth	2	2

my ecosystem is samsung and it is flawless i still have dex mode which is incred i use it for daili work earphon integr work realli well! i love it!	2	2
unless you re some type of profession photograph no one is carri a dedic camera around flagship smartphon at thi point do more than enough for daili and vacat photo for most now if it s a wed or someth then you hire photographers!	2	2
america ha draft tactic such as watch or differ type of cellular devic if you have the intellig to use certain devic or watch with that intellig then your draft even your name you can be draft becaus your name is michael	1	1
i have both and i like the s25 ultra better onli thing keep me on iphon imessag and facetim	2	2

i ve switch sinc ip14promax and mostli appl devic to the samsung eco system becaus i wa bore with the iphon i still use a mac studio and macbook pro but replac my phone and tablet and watch for top of the line samsung product instead of icloud i use onedr and so far so good also sync on my pc and laptop icloud could also do that though samsung phone are realli good and oneui destroy io for me now first time ever sinc smartphon i switch to android and not go back anytim soon if ever also order a nice samsung laptop becaus i like window better than maco sinc w11	2	2
josh is so cute and he s also a swifti	2	2
i m an iphon guy but you can t go wrong with almost ani high end android phone fortun we have a ton of great option and it s easier to switch back and forth between oper system	1	1
thi guy look like zack morri from sbtb	1	1
stop watch when you gave the assstant win to iphon appl fan boy detect	2	2
your actual wrong about both have 120hz display	0	0

iphon 16 pro max is what i m use and i feel secur in everi aspect i tri s24 ultra but i realli am not secur and confid while use s24 ultra i m back to appl iphon with 16 pro max	1	1
spec wise the s25 ultra is better in everi way but the iphon is so optim that it ll be on par or just slightli slower than the s25 ultra also if we talk about game iphon game i feel are more optim also with the iphon you get a lot of other thing that you don t get with the s25 ultra that is the best smart watch seamless airpod connect with all it featur seamless connect between the iphon and macbook if you re a editor edit on a macbook it a no brainer to be use an iphon so it all that when it come to iphon and peopl s prefer toward the phone but yeah just sole talk about the phone no phone in the world come close to the beast itself the powerhous and the ultim phone ye ofcours i m talk about the s25 ultra	2	2
i can t watch these sponsor fake review vid anymore!	0	0
the way i choos between the 2 if i prefer to be more product i go with samsung s25 ultra if i prefer more social media upload then i go with iphon 16 pm	2	2
some nifti featur are overlook in thi comparison for exampl veri much use ai veri effici s pen veri help galaxi routin revers charg and so on !!! samsung made my life veri easi tbh!	2	2
noth compar to io most peopl are too dumb to understand design languag and tini detail but everyth about io is just perfect they just get it simpl as that buy the phone you like but appl is just the kind of design languag and they don t glue their camera ring on	2	2

samsung got rob on the mic qualiti test over the video the samsung sound way clearer imo	2	1
i m a window user and s25 ultra is overal a better phone android and window work great togeth so s25 ultra	2	2
just ad one more thing no phone in the world come close to the overal perform of the s25 ultra except for the oneplu 13 it actual a realli close contend but still not better than the s25 ultra yeah it just that good can t do anyth about it	2	2
one aspect of the samsung ecosystem that you miss wa that they also make applianc and home theater i have a samsung rang i can get a notif when it is preheat on my tv tablet watch and phone if i want	1	1
s25 ultra is on anoth level	1	1
io is not as good as android in qualiti of life featur android just ha so mani more where even basic android phone ha featur that io doesn t have such as back gestur clipboard notif histori differ sound level option no mention how mani hour till alarm ring notif histori make pip for map amongst other	2	2

samsung ha like 2 duplic app now	1	1
an excel devic and probabl one of the best option around the world if money is no issu but if money is an issu an old ap c dslr with a 135mm prime len will be far less expens and last mani year more thi extraordinari devic could be an excel companion for somebodi seriou about photographi but if you are seriou then you alreadi have a dedic camera i imagin and if you aren t seriou then use it for selfi and food won t be differ than use ani other smartphon	2	2

hi i realli need your opinion it s the onli one i trust i m veri inspir by the vivo x200 ultra camera but i m unsur about the 35mm main len i m use to a 24mm len on my profession camera for year and i m not sure how i ll feel use 35mm all the time still i understand the import and imag qualiti benefit of 35mm that s whi i m consid the 200 pro instead but no blogger compar the ultra and the pro directli i can t tell how much better the ultra realli is would it be smarter to go with the global version of the pro rather than the ultra with a chines rom? and if i do choos the pro is it worth pay extra for the global version or is the chines rom with some tweak just as good or even better in term of optim and quality?	2	2
pleas	1	1
that s whi i went for the vivo x200 ultra it might not have the bell and whistl of the ultra camera but the size realli is perfect	1	1
pleas compar it with iphon	1	1
did you have ani cellular issu use the device? it s my onli concern	1	1
so is there ani workaround for wearo watch on thi phone or not? on some china rom phone you can get it work if not what is the smart watch you could recommend for replac galaxi watch ultra	1	1
after some mess about i wa abl to regist for a vivo account on my comput use my email address after that i wa abl to log in to it on my vivo phone and take advantag of the extra featur	1	1
i see the direct vivo is go and i like it! their almost abl to use the same sensor for all three focal lengths! imagin the day where lens and sensor get optimis to the point where they can use 1 inch sensor for all of them	1	1
we need to go back to have normal size phone with crazi creativ design that aren t just giant white brick with a giant bumpi circular camera lens that cover 50 of the back sure we do love have nice camera but i dont want to cari a camera that is also a phone in my pocket i want a phone that is also a camera	2	2
i think thi is one of those case where call it camera island is abso bloodi lute valid and justifi	1	1
we all just need a global version	1	1
such a shame it not go to be a global releas no wear os support and no circl to search mean no way for me	1	1
great job by allen gave us the spec and the good and not so good aspect of the shoe thank for anoth great video from weartest	2	2

rememb fast charg shorter lifespan everi refer i read state that to maxim the life of your batteri keep the power level between 20 and 90 tri not to go under and do not charg to 100 if you want max batteri output life and 99 of all power bank maker state the capac of their pb to be let say 20 000mah the actual output will be between 10 and 20 less than the 20 000mah state with 20 less output be the norm batteri that output of 90 and abov simpli underst the actual capac so it appear they have more effici batteri a 20 000mah may have 22 000mah actual capac so it may appear that it is 90 effici more capac more weight unless they fudg the number also check for pass through charg mani maker do not build that capabl into their pb to cut manufactur cost pass through charg mean you can charg the pb and devic s connect to the pb simultan	1	1
love anker it so reliabl and hold full charg even after 6 month	2	2

i have to say ev are biggest con in the last hundr year for a start just imagin for a second buyer have to pay extra on top of the alreadi inflat price of an ev to get extra rang you should alreadi have ! serious what a con ! ev are electr guzzler it s a proven fact when you load up an ev compar to an equival ice vehicl the ev will run out of power much faster add to that the minut you take possess of your ev and start use it gradual that huge expens batteri pack is go to degrad and your rang and then a massiv chunk out of your bank account to replac that expend batteri with out ani doubt after the warranti run out if you want a good abbrevi for the word scam it is ev !	0	0

veri ugli look car shame they use the mustang name	0	0
most peopl wouldn t drive more than 300 mile in one day so the 45 min charg becom less relev imo becaus you recharg it overnight for those who do sure it ll take longer but not as much as you might think by the time you factor in food stop and toilet break plu you may not need to charg to 100 to get to your destin for that overnight charg thi is my experi as a tesla 3 driver current my first 200 mile is free from home solar but the extra 100 mile sure is veri tempt	2	2
the mach e gt perform can do 0 to 60 in 3 3 second just like the model 3 but the rang is less about 280 mile i heard that the mach e is more comfort and quieter also i like that the mach e ha the speedomet right in front of the driver seat like everi car other than a tesla so after watch mani comparison video i place an order for a 2025 mach e gt perform	2	2
