Just returned my Pixel 8a - genuinely the worst phone I've ever owned - going to replace it with the CMF Phone 2,negative,negative
And that's why I heard your advice and got a OnePlus 13 when it came out,neutral,neutral
Ridiculous to think one plus is the best camera..... nah,positive,positive
Foul mouthed and slightly drunk,neutral,neutral
OP 13 is the best surely.,positive,positive
Samsung s25 should be in best smartphone list,positive,positive

It is alaround the best for sure. I can say Pixel has the best photo, in my opinion, but OnePlus just does everything excellently.",positive,positive

OnePlus 13 is KING,neutral,neutral
"For me, I went for Poco f7 Ultra after watching your review. It's a bit cheaper in my country and also comes with Dolby Atmos support which the OP13 lacks. The cameras are also super good ( not flagship level for sure but they still quite good ) . Thanks uncle ! Keep up the good work",positive,positive
What about gt 30 pro and poco x7 pro and poco f7 in the budget and mid range part?,neutral,neutral

"On a side note, have you ever checked out or did a review on Realme GT7 pro? I remember you making a video on it but I just can’t seem to find it. I could be misremembering it.",neutral,neutral
My favourite so far has got to be the honor gt pro. Cameras aside. It's definitely the best value for money,positive,positive
@TechSpurt pls tell me if I should buy Samsung A35 or nothing phone 3a . Pls let me know . I’m leaning more for camera for content creation and all. But I feel like I also want it to be durable cuz I might hand it over to my mother after a year or so .,neutral,neutral
This time I went with the normal s25 for its size. But overall I think that s25 ultra and Honor magic 7 pro are the best overall,positive,positive

"Yo guys, I am looking to get a new phone in August - November time. I currently have a pixel 7 pro. I will have around £1100 - £1200 to spend. I know that phone choices are personal preference but there are so many phones out there that are good and I would like some outside views and thoughts on what I should get or at least think of getting. I won't be getting an iPhone of any kind tho because I prefer Android. I live in the UK and I know that there are some phones that aren't available here. I am open to any phone (like oppo or Google or Samsung or Xiaomi etc). Thanks guys 👍",positive,positive

OnePlus 13 would be the one for me too :),neutral,neutral
If you aren't buying flaship then choose samsung / google / apple. Others dont' give good update policies.  If you are buying budget device only samsung i recommend.,positive,positive
The intro was way too funny for me 😂,neutral,neutral
Mau 1 tapi gak ada money nya buat beli😅😅😅😅😅,neutral,neutral
The Nothing 3a Pro would be perfect for me if it came in a 512gb variant as well...🤔I would probably go OP13 but i just cant justify spending £850 on a bloody phone. There are plenty of decent ones out for about the £500 price point that will do a perfectly good job...,positive,positive
As always very entertaining. Thank you mate !!!,neutral,neutral
Thank you for  the great videos you the best,positive,positive
After watching you review the honor magic 7pro i decided to get it and after almost 4 months i honestly love it still. Cheers spurt,positive,positive

"Damn Uncle Spurt.. you chose my OnePlus 13 16/512 Arctic Dawn!! I'm shocked & grateful. 
I got fed up with the three-tier monopoly so I jumped ship & never looked back. The new standard has been set.
OP13 Chinese ROM was released April 2024 but yeah, we got ours New Years. -Cheers from Finland 🇫🇮",neutral,neutral
