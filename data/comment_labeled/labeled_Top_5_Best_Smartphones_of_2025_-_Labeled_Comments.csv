5000nits saf,neutral,neutral
"So it's just about the cameras? What about the real world use of the phone in terms of ease of use,  useful features, and productivity??? But noooo it's just all fluff about tech specs. I highly doubt you even used these devices. 

This is a stupid list.",positive,positive
"The real top 5:
Vivo x200 ultra 
Vivo x200 pro
Oppo find x8 ultra 
Oppo find x8 pro
Xiaomi 15 ultra",neutral,neutral

Me on Oneplus 13 💪💪💯😎💯😎💯😎💯😎,neutral,neutral
I actually think the OnePlus 13 camera system beats other flagships in the UK. I prefer the colour science,neutral,neutral
I enjoy looking at the comments saying x is the best by miles. Thanks for fueling the arguments 🍿,positive,positive
You all know yall use iphones,neutral,neutral
Xiaomi 15 🧡,neutral,neutral
If Iqoo 13 had Vivo X200 Ultra cameras...its basically the same phone.,neutral,neutral
I've tried 4 of the 5 and own the oneplus and ultra 25. I find it impossible to choose between the two.  Seems this year might be a tie for me unless Nothing does something really special.,neutral,neutral
Why no folding phones could have gone with a fold 6,neutral,neutral
Bro why you dont make a video without glasses??,neutral,neutral

Saf you and I both know that it should have been the vivoX200 ultra in the top 5 list instead of the xiaomi 15 ultra if the vivoX200 ultra had a global release by now. Sad.,neutral,neutral

"I have never used iphone before, and I really wish to, even if it's Iphone 2 especially for my ASMR channel",neutral,neutral

Wheres Iphone 😂,neutral,neutral
Honor 400 pro all the way ❤🎉,neutral,neutral
"I have the IPhone for banks and other and Vivo for photos and entertainment. I think it’s the best all around setup you can get (instead of iPhone you can get some mid core Honor for 350$ with face scanner, same level of security but less expensive. I promise it’s the best phone setup you can have",positive,positive
"I've been fortunate to have every top phone this year including s25 ultra, plus and edge, iPhone 16 pro and pro max, OnePlus 13, Xiaomi 15 ultra, oppo find x8. I am hyper fussy and specific in what I look for in a phone. Have to say that as yet there has not been a phone in this list that ticks every box for me however the OnePlus 13 hits most of the boxes. The only thing that lets it down for me (personally) was the offset camera . I hoped the oppo find x8 was going to be the phone that addressed this but lost out due to poor fingerprint sensor location and dreadful haptics. The honor magic 7 pro is a high contender and next on my list and could take the spot from the OnePlus 13",negative,negative

Buena elección el vivo 200 ultra es bueno en todo no solo en cámaras en todos sus sistemas cumple al 100% lo único que en la parte de cámara se despega a un 200% comparado con los demás . Repito es completo en cada apartado no es solo cámara,neutral,neutral
Huawei Pura 80 ultra,neutral,neutral
"I am a big fan of yours and always watch your videos! I don't have a smartphone yet and Samsung Galaxy S25 can be my first phone, if you give it to me then it will be my biggest wish. It has 12GB RAM, great camera and latest features. Please give me a chance to gift my first smartphone, I will be forever grateful to you! ❤️",positive,positive
Vivo x200 Pro has been my daily driver for 6 months now and I can't get enough of it! No envy for the ultra. I prefer global ROMs.,neutral,neutral

Vivo X200 ultra,neutral,neutral
"As a niche, I'd say the best phone for me is Red Magic 10 Pro. Idk about the 10s yet. I'm hoping to see more on-hand gaming reviews and thermal checks and if everything checks out to be better, I'll get it. Especially considering the price of the 1TB model.

I'll probably get a Samsung next year if they're not complacent again. I do prefer the S series to be my main phone as I still have my S21 ultra. Banger phone, but considering everything I've seen from the RM10, it definitely made my S21 feel old now",positive,positive
"9:30 So Sony makes the best camera sensors for others, but not for its own phones?",positive,positive

I absolutely love my iPhone 16 pro Max but it feels so far behind compared to a lot of these phones,positive,positive
"I'm watching this video on my new Vivo X200 Ultra. Google services and Android Auto works perfectly, you can uninstall almost every chinese apps and even turn on Circle to search. This is android guys, if you want you can do anything with your phone 😂
P.S. camera is godlike",neutral,neutral
I use iphones but if i would ever go back to android i would deff go for the vivo imo,neutral,neutral

Top 5 smartphones for millionaires 😂,neutral,neutral
"This was so helpful, thank you!",positive,positive
"Honestly dont think the S25 Ultra is worth it over the other Ultra options. X200 Ultra has FAR better cameras, better battery life and charging speeds, better IP rating, IR blaster, AND is cheaper. 

Samsung really needs to step it up, they are getting left behind by Chinese brands and its really not even close anymore.",neutral,neutral
People are sleeping on the Magic 7 Pro!,neutral,neutral
This Year X200 Ultra is The King of Smartphones.....,neutral,neutral
