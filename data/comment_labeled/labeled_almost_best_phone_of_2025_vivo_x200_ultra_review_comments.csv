"An excellent device, and probably one of the best options around the world if money is no issue. But if money is an issue an old aps-c DSLR with a 135mm prime lens will be far less expensive and last many years more. This extraordinary device could be an excellent companion for somebody serious about photography, but if you are serious then you already have a dedicated camera I imagine. And if you aren't serious then using it for selfies and food won't be different than using any other smartphone 🤔",positive,positive
Chinese.. meh. No thanks.,positive,positive

Hi. I really need your opinion — it's the only one I trust :) I'm very inspired by the Vivo X200 Ultra camera, but I'm unsure about the 35mm main lens. I'm used to a 24mm lens on my professional camera for years, and I’m not sure how I’ll feel using 35mm all the time. Still, I understand the importance and image quality benefits of 35mm. That's why I'm considering the 200 Pro instead — but no bloggers compare the Ultra and the Pro directly. I can’t tell how much better the Ultra really is. Would it be smarter to go with the global version of the Pro rather than the Ultra with a Chinese ROM?

And if I do choose the Pro, is it worth paying extra for the global version, or is the Chinese ROM with some tweaks just as good or even better in terms of optimization and quality? 😭",positive,positive
ultra系今年最强旗舰，本来还想着换x200s就好了，结果ultra强得没边了，开冲！😊,neutral,neutral
Please,neutral,neutral

That's why i went for the Vivo x200 ultra. It might not have the bells and whistles of the ultra camera. But the size really is perfect,neutral,neutral
PLEASE COMPARE IT WITH IPHONE,neutral,neutral
Did you have any cellular issues using the device? It’s my only concern,neutral,neutral
vivo ❤,neutral,neutral
so is there any workaround for wearOS watches on this phone or not? on some china rom phones you can get it working. if not what is the smart watch you could recommend for replacing galaxy watch ultra,neutral,neutral
After some messing about I was able to register for a Vivo account on my computer using my email address. After that I was able to log in to it on my Vivo phone and take advantage of the extra features.,neutral,neutral
I see the direction Vivo is going and I like it! Their almost able to use the same sensor for all three focal lengths! Imagine the day where lenses and sensors get optimised to the point where they can use 1 inch sensors for all of them.,neutral,neutral
"We need to go back to having normal-sized phones with crazy, creative designs that aren't just giant white bricks with a giant, bumpy circular camera lenses that cover 50% of the back. Sure we do love having nice cameras but I dont want to cary a camera that is also a phone in my pocket, I want a phone that is also a camera.",positive,positive
I think this is one of those cases where calling it camera island is abso-bloody-lutely valid and justified... 😁,neutral,neutral
We all just need a global version,neutral,neutral
"Such a shame its not going to be a global release, no wear OS support and no circle to search means no way for me",neutral,neutral
