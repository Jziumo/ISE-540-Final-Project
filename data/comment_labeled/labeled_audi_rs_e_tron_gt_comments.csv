How can you have had the car for 6 months and not had to top up the washer fluid once ? 
Seriously wondering 🤔",neutral,neutral
"Rory. Great long term review. £120,000 Insane! Just not for everyone...any one? Certainly better than the jelly mould Porsche it is based on. As for the Tesla.... not in the same league. Just buy a 208e and bank the rest for a rainy day.",negative,positive
Model S won't do anything like 370 miles - except perhaps for the one shot into space... A good way to tell if Tesla is lying is if Elon's lips are moving,positive,positive

Depreciation is ridiculous!! So no thank you,negative,negative
"The reason I don't buy the car is because it's too low. My knees don't allow me to get into cars that close to the street anymore.

Design is Great. Better then Porsche imo,positive,positive

Design is amazing,positive,positive
"Guys had the car for 6 months from brand new and is talking about build quality, drive it 5-10 years and then tell me if its not rattling and loose feeling.

Everything feels solid when its new

I sell cars for a living, and i sell loads of 1-2 year old cars that look brand new.

Its not that impressive",neutral,neutral

"I love the exterior style and design of this Audi e-Tron! For my Tesla Model S, it was touch-free on the outside. I could open AND close the boot or the bonnet by using the fob. It was great! I now have a 2025 Porsche Taycan which is way behind Tesla. The Taycan bonnet is like you said; you can use a hand gesture to pop the hood but it doesn't actually open all the way as Tesla's does. Porsche's boot also opens and closes all the way with a foot gesture, but you have to move your foot very slowly for it to work.",positive,positive

"Can’t believe you’re giving it such plaudits for NOT falling apart within 6 months?! Is that really an accomplishment? Especially for something so damn expensive?

My 6 year old Ford Focus is still in faultless condition but even after 6 years I would class that as impressive - cars SHOULD last 10-20 years now, as a bare minimum",positive,positive

Nice driving shots from Bedford 🙂,positive,positive
"When you are talking about a car and a price of 100.000 and higher there is no worth involved.
It's not worth.
Such cars are just showoff luxury items for the snobs to brag about their financial prowess.
These cars have a stupid high profit margin, aka buyers are being scammed as the value per dollar/euro/pound/whatever currency spent is very low.
Even a 50.000 car falls into that category, unless it has some new tech involved. (For example tesla model 3/y)
That is where you ask yourself is it worth to buy a model 3 or a something else.
What do i get for that money? And if you use the various incentives from governments to bring the sales price down (tax credit is not it) how much benefits per dollar spent do i get.?",neutral,neutral

"Can't get over the wonky tail lights, front end bumper from the new Honda Accord or Civic.. Taycan is a much better cohesive design overall. For 60k used may be worth it.",neutral,positive
"They aren’t worth the MSRP - the open market has determined this. This is one of the few cars with HUGE manufacturer discounts - because 1 year old cars are worth approximately 50% of the new list price!! No joke. I watch the wholesale market data. 

Just watched a 2022 sell for $95k CAD with a new MSRP over $200k!!!",neutral,neutral

"“That’s aside” referring to vehicles short range 😂😂😂 What is the purpose of a GT if you need to drive at 60mph to do 280 miles?
You need 5 hours to do 280 miles!!!!

That’s a town car mate, not a GT!!!",negative,positive
No thanks.,negative,neutral
"My 2022 Etron GT with 1600 miles on it has been sitting in the dealership for over 90 days due to software/computer problems.  Took the car in for software updates and the even in spite of a new computer control module being flown in from Germany and installed; the Audi regional engineers are still trying to diagnose the problem and make repairs.   To date, there has been no contact from Audi and very little information from the dealership; there has been no promise as to when the car will be drivable again.  This was my first Audi and my last Audi......In addition, would not recommend the Etron GT, especially since the car can loose over 40% of its value in the first year.",negative,neutral

"I am so confused, he said the tech isn't great but what tech do you want? I feel like people are always like oh the tech is good or bad but what does that even mean? What are people even talking about? Nobody ever even says what they mean, its like a trigger word like 'sustainability' like it means something but it doesn't. I had a Tesla and an etron GT and I can tell you that the etron GT was MONUMENTALLY nicer than the Tesla. I guess the etron doesn't have pointless games and a fart noise maker though...? Is that what people mean by tech? The only positive to Tesla is range I didn't need and the charging network.",neutral,neutral
"Great review, seems a very versatile car",positive,positive
"It looks like a very low tech basic EV, maybe 40k is a reasonable price. I don't believe Germans can sell EVs, they are just too nostalgic and extremely overpriced! They will fade away, watch their EV sales numbers",neutral,neutral
"thanks bro, pretty timely and informative, the length of time sitting waiting on recharge however . . . i dunno",positive,positive
No way is it worth £120k. The price of new cars is completely out of control now & after the autumn budget it looks like Dacia will sell a lot of cars. Anyway look at the second hand values of any Audi hybrid or electric cars. Dropping like stones.,positive,positive
"You are the best reviewer on YouTube, so well done. I got an E-Tron, and I can't get more than 200 miles from a full charge, but it not very often I need more in a signal journey. but it is a great car and so comfortable. I love to have a GT but not in my price range",positive,positive
"Does it have a ""*"" button on a steering wheel? My A4 has it and you can choose a function for that key by yourself. I am using it for drive select.",neutral,neutral
Hell no not worth it. You can get a used r8 for half the price. And not deal with the extra pain in the ass an electric car becomes when it needs repaired.  Why pay more for a more expensive to fix car that performes the exact same as an r 8 that costs twice as much? Lol. Its def a hard pass for me. F that,negative,negative
"I actually like Audi not going full on into developing an entire infotainment system. No matter what car you produce it's always the case that by the end of the production, the system and the apps on it are already outdated. Android and iOS apps are moving at lightspeed and there is no point of racing against them. Simple Android Auto and Apple Carplay is more than enough. They are basically offering you wireless displays to which you can connect your phone to your car. It can't get any more personalized than that.",positive,positive
Short answer: Yes.,positive,positive
If you can afford one you can afford fuel so go buy an rs7 you have no compromises,neutral,neutral
"Love the review sir!

Have owned a 22 Prem (just below RS) for 22k miles from new.   It’s my daily driver.  I’m 6’5” and all legs, but find it comfortable.  Getting in-out of such a low car can be tricky. 

The car is solid, but it has had some major recalls and failures (heater recall, brakes repairs {no recall}.  There is no over-the -air software update I think to support the dealership model. That force us back to dealership for software which is crazy, but I get it. 

This review some what matches my is real life experiences.  It frank and honest,but  I think he nip-pic on stuff that just doesn’t matter.  

*Never had issue with door handle pitching me, I agree not good if it happens. 
*True there is no good spot to put phone.  I put my IP+ on the floor or on passenger seat.  
* the phone charger in the compartment is crappy. Over heats like other car due to lack of ventilation. IP+ in case is too large and not worth hassle. I use a cable plugged into back seat. 
*  tires are pricey but you can find reasonable options. *deprecation/loss of value hit is real and bad. Cost of doing business to a degree.  I wished I had leased, water up the bridge at this point. *range is better than Audi advertise which is better than not getting what was advertised. * tech is basic, but not horrible. The MMI system could use some improvements. You have to repeatedly reset or acknowledge app updates.  

I love the car, but she ain’t perfect.  Would still take it over any Telsa model.  

I would still chose GT over Taycan because of external  profile and internal layout (lack of buttons).",neutral,neutral
