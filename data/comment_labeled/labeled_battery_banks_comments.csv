I just ordered the 100W Ugreen charger and was looking for a video that would recommend a better one until I saw the number one in your video. I guess I made the right choice.,positive,positive
Nice vid Thx,positive,positive
wow.... nitecore didn't get a look in.,neutral,neutral
Big fan of your videos. Keep up the good work! <3,positive,positive
"Thank you for the fantastic review!
I was looking at the ugreen charger, and of course a bunch of adds for other powerbanks from their companu started to pop up... Any thought on the UGREEN Nexode Power Bank 25000mAh 200W?",positive,positive
Where do you shop for groceries?  I wish I could spend under $250 a week on groceries.  😉,neutral,neutral
"Like it feels good in my hand 

Maybe don’t do that next time 😂",positive,positive
FINALLY NO BS,positive,positive
Anker powerbank is awesome i have the previous model of the prime and it's been one of the best purchases I've done,positive,positive
Definitely fast coverage of info.,neutral,positive
"5:04 It only gets 100 watts with the optional base charging unit, otherwise you can only manage 65 watts, which is still fast.  Downside, this pack won't charge any other powerbank like the Nano through USB C.",neutral,neutral
Is it power delivery?,neutral,neutral
"This is an amazing no-nonsense review, thank you so much! You just earned a new subscriber",positive,positive
Thanks Bro,positive,positive
Cool batteries and all but nice bicep vein 😂😂😂😂,positive,positive
"Don't need a jackery, there are several power banks above 20k mah I have a few to power my laptop",neutral,neutral
Is this me or ugreen winning in every category of products. I have nothing against ugreen but i know for a fact that they pay youtubers good money despite what they say.,positive,positive
"The price and performance of that 20,000 Iniu puts it at #1 for most folk  ;)",positive,positive
Just did my purchase according to these reviews!!!! Doesn't matter which one but it helped a lot!!! Thanks mate...,neutral,neutral
No shargeek chargers making top 5?,positive,positive
"Such great information. Could explain how you get the temperature numbers for these items? I mean, 61ºF is the hottest you recorded. Is that above ambient? Again, terrific review as always.",neutral,neutral
Did you notice the Anker GanPrime was sturdy when plugged into the outlet given that it's only a 2 prong not a 3?,neutral,neutral
I've got a INIU 10000mAh 22w and love it.  It also has a light if needed :) Best £20 i spent.,positive,positive
"better to make a weight table and also other table with characteristics. would be useful to compare. i personally have iniu 10k powerbank, it charges slowly but i use it daily, so no problem, the smallest and lightest and cheapest. and i have an old 20k baseus powerbank that charges really quick! i like to pick it to hiking trips. my recommendations",neutral,neutral
You can tell who sponsored his video with the opening comment... Anchor,neutral,neutral
"My powerbank it’s wayyyy better and cheaper than all these batteries combined.
“Koosed” 1
USB A and 2 type C (100w in/out max 145w out ) 27.000 mah and it only cost me 55€ plus a 100 W charger with 2 usb c and type A for 24€",positive,positive
"Lean, hard and fast info, not some 45 min blah blah blah video. THANK YOU",neutral,neutral
"This review, while meant well, didn’t actually test anything.  And it would have been soooooo easy",positive,positive
One of your funniest videos ever. Im impressed at how many references you use. Very clever,positive,positive
"The Ugreen 100W powerbank is fantastic indeed, and performs incredibly well, though i agree that its really slippery, so i usually keep it inside its little bag.

I am using it to charge my Vivo X100, because it is one of the few that supports PPS charging up to 20V and 5A that the X100 is able to accept.",neutral,neutral
"Holding up a product for display please do not place it in front of Monty, that’s just plain rude",neutral,negative
do you mind reviewing some usb-c magnetic adapters? please T_T,neutral,neutral
"Can U do a magnetic power charger 4📱? I just hate connecting wire 2 charger up my 📱. Thank U 4 the 🕙. N Thank U 4 showing. 👍
BTW now AMNZ U GREEN is a $79.99.",negative,negative
"I am one of those people who thinks ""I should get one"".  And, then, I realise that I cannot come up with a good reason.",positive,positive
"I don't understand why Anker prime 20k is second, but you didn't envolved anker 737 which i use regularly and is a 24k plus the pros of the prime, charging it at 100W with 140W total output, c1 100W, and same screen 🤔 could you do a video on your opinion about all the anker powerbanks?",neutral,neutral
"Excellent video except the sexual dirty remarks made, quite unnecessary.",neutral,neutral
That dog is SO stinking cute!,neutral,positive
"Thanks for the review...appreciate the capacity test numbers to verify you get what's being advertised.  I'm seeing a lot of Anker Prime knockoffs on Amazon with $60-80 pricing and thinking they can't have the actual mAH capacity they are touting.  Lastly, could you start adding a mention if each power bank supports pass-through charging as well.  This is one reason I chose the Anker Prime, that I can run a USB-C device (like the new Starlink Mini) WHILE also charging/maintaining the Anker Prime power bank with my foldable 45w solar panel.",neutral,neutral
5:18 Even the dog wants you to STOP!,positive,positive
"I just purchased one, battery is 0, I'm charging for 4 hours and continues 0",neutral,neutral

"I use the Anker 27,650 power bank for my Meta Quest 3..... is much bigger than the 20k you have on there... cheers!",positive,positive
"Have you tried out the omnicharge 20C+? If so, how does it compare to the rest of the power banks?",neutral,neutral
I need a power bank to recharge my brain. All these camera switches were exhausting!,negative,negative
"you need to test PB1165mi, one porblem it has it does not have USB A out",neutral,neutral
Is Monty a real dog? Dogs aside one thing that cannot be tested with a review is reliability and when established players have a good reputation it is hard to go past them if you don't want to take a chance.,neutral,neutral
What are you doing to that power bank bro 😭😭😭,neutral,neutral
"Are used to enjoy your videos whoever I don’t like them anymore. The way you edit them with them being so fast in the sense of to a new picture talking very fast just the editing of the whole videos is crap now it’s kinda actually nauseating watching it for me, I can understand why you do it. It’s because you’re trying to keep the attention of the younger generation because they have such a short attention span. I don’t like it. I don’t watch your videos anymore because of it your ostracizing the group in my opinion cheers.",neutral,negative
"1:21 it’s common knowledge 101 that always keeping a battery at 100% is a bad thing!

The fact that this is my first introduction to your channel and you didn’t know that doesn’t bode well for you",negative,negative
I like Anker but too many cables of theirs have filed on me. But their other stuff has been solid.,neutral,neutral

thank u kind sir,positive,positive
Thank you :),positive,positive
Unfortunately the jack all trades powerbank is not efficient. I do not recommend it at all.  Better to carry a powerbank and an adapter for better overall performance,neutral,neutral
your dog can do what most humans cant do.,neutral,positive
Which one to buy just to charge my phone and bring it everywhere with me?,neutral,neutral
"Excellent review @MobileReviewsEh!, I saw this one, Yoocas Portable Power Bank, 2 in1 Hybrid Charger-10000mAh, and looks like the first Anker with a nicer screen, but wonder how well will do with your tests?, is cheaper and seems to offer exactly the same as the Anker.",positive,positive
fake reviews. You only able to know its fake or not to open up the powerbank most om them are fake. They declaring 2000 but the battery itself ist mostly 1000mah.,negative,negative
Anker 733 I have and the Anker 165w 25k,positive,positive

I am suprised  anker 737 didnt make the list,neutral,neutral
Can you please make a video for best solar powered bank charger too,neutral,positive
"Remember, fast charging = shorter lifespan. Every reference I read states that to maximize the life of your battery, keep the power level between 20% and 90%. Try not to go under and do not charge to 100% if you want max battery output life. And...99% of all power bank makers state the capacity of their PBs to be lets say 20,000mAh. The actual output will be between 10% and 20% less than the 20,000mAh stated, with 20% less output being the norm. Batteries that output of 90% and above simply UNDERSTATE the actual capacity so it appears they have more efficient batteries. A 20,000mAh may have 22,000mAh actual capacity, so it may appear that it is 90% efficient. More capacity = more weight, unless they fudged the numbers. Also, check for pass-through charging. Many makers do not build that capability into their PBs to cut manufacturing costs. Pass-through charging means you can charge the PB and device(s) connected to the PB simultaneously.",neutral,neutral
Love anker.  Its so reliable and holds full charge even after 6 months.,positive,positive
Have you thought about adding UK affiliate links?  I've spent a couple of £100 thanks to you.,neutral,neutral

"I am so happy that this channel took off, I been watching your videos since 10k subs and always come back to see videos of the products I am interested in. Glad to see you blew up since then. Although I do miss the fact that you no longer heart every comment or leave a reply to them as much anymore but I understand why, it becomes difficult when your channel grows.",positive,positive
"why not UGREEN 145W 25,000mAh?",neutral,neutral
What about the Shargeek 140? Its the best in my opinion.,positive,positive
No capacity test. Skipped,neutral,neutral

Love you channel but 5:18 was uncalled for,positive,positive
"when you say dollar, do you mean American or Canadian?",neutral,neutral
I love the two in 1 but the plug comes out of every wall I put it in. Would be perfect if it had a additional plug with a wire.,positive,positive
How do you get a dog to sit still like that? Is it CGI?,neutral,neutral
"I think I would rather put my money on Anker for longevity & safety, who knows where Ugreen is assembled let alone the durability.",neutral,neutral
Anyway you can do a solar powered version of these please,neutral,neutral
"Quite an amateur review. Waste of time. The guy obviously has no idea about efficiency and voltage difference, let alone total power consumption.",negative,negative
"Basically what i need is :

1. Fast charging power bank (not too extreme like 100+ watts, but at least 25 watts)
2. Pass through charging (you can charge the power bank itself from the wall socket but simultaneously charging your phone too)",neutral,neutral
The dog is waiting for you to hurry up because he's hungry 😅,neutral,neutral
All the shhh sounds in his words are killing the video man scrub audio before publishing so people don’t get lost in all the shhhh couldn’t you make while speaking.,neutral,neutral
