"18,000 miles on my '22 Mach-e.  No issues so far.",positive,positive
"Its not a Mustang, never will be why they have to mess up all the muscle cars up is beyond me",negative,negative
the Mach E is the best EV overall of all EVs currently under $50k..& best thing about it: Musk rat is not in your life,positive,positive
The Hyundai Kona doesn’t have a fake trunk and I’m pretty pissed about it the whole wanna be engine component thing,neutral,neutral
ouch 45 mins that would suck on a road trip,neutral,neutral
....and now the Mach-E can charge at Tesla chargers.  So much for the Mach-E's problem #1.,positive,positive
"As a Ford owner I really want to like the Mustang Mach-E. As a first effort (ignoring the Focus Electric) it has a lot going for it but not quite enough for me to buy one. The two biggest issues for me are: 1) how quickly the price escalates when you opt for the bigger battery, AWD and upgrade trim level and 2) its efficiency. The 37kWh/100 mile puts it pretty far back in the pack of current EVs. EV buyers should prioritize this at least as much as range as this is a measure of how much it will cost to drive. I'm confident Ford's next effort will be more competitive but if I end up shopping for an EV before that happens I'll be looking elsewhere.",negative,negative
"You forgot to mention the additional dealer markup to the Mach-E, which makes it even more expensive.",neutral,neutral
"Not sure where he got his numbers from, but I had a MY and it never charged 0-80% in 15 minutes. Hell, it’s slower than the EV6 and even that car only touts 20-80 in 18 minutes",negative,negative
45 minutes isnt bad! Thats lunch,negative,negative
Thinking to get a Mach e or model y after My Ioniq5 had an ICCU recall. They updated the software twice h then the ICCU finally failed and left my ass stranded the other day. Now it's gonna take them over a month to fix they don't even know actually TBA didn't even give me a comparable loaner. Other people are saying their io5 still has  iccu problem after. Can't decide i just want a reliable EV car that won't break down darn it!!,negative,negative
I like the body style and the look of it. Can you get it in a gas model or a hybrid? Electric cars or throwaway cars when a cell goes bad you’re done.,negative,negative
He's the truth... How about running a MustingE head to head with ANY Gas Mustang from NYC to LA and see who get's there first and how far behind the MUSTANG E is when ANY Gas Mustang gets to LA.,neutral,neutral
Guys I just test drove a mustang suv today. He wasn’t lying about the 0-60 comment!,positive,positive
"The Mustang Mach-e is one of those ""Almost There"" products.  Its looks and fit/finish are top of class, but the lack of a heat pump and its ""Mid"" DCFC speeds keeps me and many others from buying it.  Drove over 1000 miles in one, and came away very impressed.",positive,positive
I am driving a Mach-E at my work. It is like driving a magic carpet. I did not think I would like an electric car. But after driving the Mach-E. I want my own sooooo bad.,positive,positive
This whole thing is a con no pros about it...its not even a real mustang..its a glorified battery operated mini SUV and did a marketing hack job by gluing a plastic horse on a car..,negative,negative
I would rather drive a mustang than a swasticar or wankpanzer.,neutral,neutral
My Model Y did not charge 0-80% in 16 minutes.,neutral,neutral
"Thank you, Alex, for the five minute format❤",neutral,positive
"20,000 sold in 9 months is fucking embarrassing. It isnt even a new ev",negative,negative
"When “Mach” is pronounced “Mack” instead of “Mock”, people can’t stop thinking about “Mustang Mac and Cheese”.",neutral,neutral
"Sadly, it failed my expectations after this great video.",negative,positive
It is a looker...an ugly looker...lol,negative,negative
I love this car so much. I look at it every single time I see it parked. I really love it!,positive,positive
"Love your energy and the to the point delivery.  Question  Why does it look like a suv, but it's being compared to a car? Is it the style of the Mach E? Thanks, living in MI makes this a  no-go winter, which is always a factor to consider with electric cars.",positive,positive
i was going to buy one but probably not anymore thanks Alex,positive,positive
"That was a fair comparison, with no Tesla hate. Kudos.",neutral,neutral
Great short report one more con no towing allowed for US version vs Y 3500#,positive,positive
Like these comparisons. Still shopping around to see what makes sense for our wallet. Do you know if the Mach E will be revising their battery type in the coming years?,neutral,neutral

I was going to buy a Model Y until Elon got so psycho. My Mach-E is fantastic! No regrets. And I'm glad not one nickel of my money is going to Lone Skum.,positive,positive
Can I go w/o charging at my house alone?,neutral,neutral
As long as Ford Mach E got 7500 Tax Credit. Seem Ford don't care about it.,neutral,neutral
Ford missed there mark. Just put a 69 body on a frame. Would have sold more.,negative,positive
Don’t forget the extra 1 second. It’s not 5.,neutral,neutral
The Mach E it’s a looker only when u see it once or twice. More you see it more it gets overly lined and doesn’t hold design in my eyes. That’s why European makers stay away from those over curved lines,neutral,neutral
You can put a Machine Gun Nest in the fronk. Just saying.,neutral,neutral
Honestly who needs these headaches in one’s life,negative,negative
Ford states 96hrs to Charge.,neutral,neutral
if they made an eco boost hybrid model it would probably be hot,positive,positive
"Very nice car...still like my Ioniq5 AWD Ultimate better! Drove several Mach E's before buying the I5, no regrets at all! Ford I think has done well with it and wish them great success in the future!
Mike😊",positive,positive
Good luck if your software update fails and your car refuses to start.  Passing on this garbage excuse of a vehicle.,negative,negative
I'm thinking of trading in my Camaro for this car...,positive,positive
MEX-e  ,neutral,neutral
Had mine for 3 months and IN LOVE! Great car and quality.,positive,positive
I can tell you one of the biggest Con on this car is it's ugly as hell why couldn't Ford make a decent looking car not like a pinto or something other than that hideous thing that they put on the market,negative,negative
I have a select and I charge 30% to 80% in 20 minutes.  Most people don't run there cars under that.,positive,positive
I don’t know what Ford was thinking when they decided to name this thing after “Mustang”! In no way does it have the sporty look of historical Mustangs and it’s ugly as hell from the front. Nothing about its looks says buy me.,negative,negative
Speak in km/h please,neutral,neutral
"The frunk on the Mach E isnt that big, esp compared to frunks on other evs. I really like this car, but idk if I like it enough to spend $40K on it. It is a mustang tho. I wonder if Ford added the brand name for the $$$$ it can bring in",neutral,neutral
Imagine owning the ugliest mustang to date,negative,negative
The biggest con is that is not a Mustang. Biggest Pro is that the station wagon is alive and well but Ford wants to make on SUV for the cool soccer mom😂,positive,positive
You forgot a BIG Con. You can only get max power for about 5 seconds and then there’s a huge drop,negative,negative
Ok.... I forgive you.  The format change was a good idea.  A different voice with a different message was needed.,positive,positive
A very balanced review and comparison.,positive,positive
All cons,negative,negative
"There are no pros. If you buy one, it's because you are a poser. I hate EVs, but even I know that teslas are a smarter buy if you must have an EV. The ford is slower, heavier, and somehow uglier to look at, plus the fact that they slapped a pony logo on an SUV is just depressing. There are no pros to having a mach-e, only laughs and head shakes from car enthusiasts, sad and/or angry glances from ford fans, and open mockery from pretty much everyone who sees how thirsty you are. 

Facts.",negative,negative
"They should have just removed the name Mustang from it and just call it Ford Mach E, everyone would be happy",positive,positive
They should called it the ford donkey or the electric burro. Doesn’t look like a mustang. The pintostangs have more mustang blood in them than this.,negative,negative
"Hey, all I want to see is a rugged road test with the Mach E participating with other EVs.  This includes the Bolt!",neutral,neutral
Range “LIES”!,neutral,neutral
I could do a Tesla but I don’t like the Nazi saluting wannabe oligarch that comes with those.,neutral,neutral
I owned a 21 Premium Mach-E for 18 months.  It was the most fun car to drive that I have ever owned.  The down side for me was that we travel a bunch and the charging time needed for our trips was a pain.  Traded the Mach-E for a PHEV and it is nice to not have to worry about charging when we travel while still being mostly electric for our normal weekly routine.,positive,positive
Why can’t Tesla make a decent looking vehicle? This is where Mach E blows Tesla out of the water! Problem is I’m not paying 75k for looks. Mustang has much work to do in the performance / price arena. $ 75k for a Ford? Uh no.,positive,positive
"I just bought a brand new 2024 MachE GT with the performance upgrade and bronze package at a price of $56,000 ($59k after tax and registration). I also got 0% interest for 72 months as well as a Ford home pro charger and free home installation (which is around another $3000 give or take) that was free.  Zero regrets whatsoever, already put 700 miles on it.  It’s the funnest car I’ve ever driven, to include the fully loaded model y that my buddy let me take care of for two weeks while he left town.  Don’t get me wrong, the Tesla was fun to drive, but the Mach e interior is more comfortable and it has a certain look to it that stands out from the typical Tesla crowd.  As an added bonus, I don’t have to worry about some psychos out there keying my car 🤷🏻‍♂️",positive,positive
Beautiful looking E,positive,positive
Waiting for 500 mile range and fast changing 10-15 minutes.. Hybrid cars for me for now otherwise.,positive,positive
"If you don’t get the GT or Rally version, you are only getting rear wheel drive.  No good for anyone who has to drive in snow and icy conditions.",negative,negative
"2:00 charging 10 to 80% in the 2024 Mach e takes 32 minutes, not 45 minutes.",neutral,neutral
"I have to say, EVs are biggest con in the last hundred years .
 For a start , just imagine for a second buyers having to pay extra on top of the already inflated price of an EV to get extra range YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE !
  Seriously, what a con !
 EVs are electricity guzzlers, it’s a  proven fact, when you load up an EV compared to an equivalent ICE vehicle, the EV will run out of power much faster. 
 Add to that , the minute  you take possession of your EV and start using it gradually that hugely expensive battery pack is going to degrade , and your range and then a massive chunk out of your bank account to replace that expended battery with out any doubt after the warranty runs out. 
 If you want a good abbreviation for the word scam  , it is EV !",negative,negative
Ford has a long way to go.  I agree 100% if you don’t have a home charger then don’t bother.,negative,negative
I'm very interested in buying one and along with getting the best value for my money I have zero desire to give Musk any of my dollars. I'm content to wait for other companies that treat their workers better close the gap. Musk's actions are a MAJOR turn off!  I will continue to gather more information before making my purchase.,positive,positive
Know that number on the Tesla charger is not correct it takes at least 20 minutes to go from 20 to 80,negative,negative
"Ford should NEVER have named that Lincoln Navigator sized turd a Mustang. They should have called it a ""Farley"".",neutral,neutral
"I did not watch the video. However, just take some glue and put a couple mustangs on a car does not make it a Mustang. It does not even look like a Mustang and it is electric. Enough said? No, since when does a Mustang have 4 doors?",neutral,neutral
"The Mach E has familiar stalks and the Ford dealership to support you when there is any trouble.  Once they use the NACS (Tesla) superchargers as standard, the car rental companies would be more welcoming to this car.",positive,positive
Very ugly looking car. Shame they used the mustang name,negative,negative
"Most people wouldn't drive more than 300 Miles in one day, so the 45 min charge becomes less relevant imo, because you recharge it overnight. For those who do, sure, it'll take longer, but not as much as you might think by the time you factor in food stops and toilet breaks, plus; you may not need to charge to 100% to get to your destination for that overnight charge. This is my experience as a Tesla 3 driver. Currently my first 200 Miles is free from home solar, but the extra 100 Miles sure is very tempting..",positive,positive
"The Mach E GT performance can do 0 to 60 in 3.3 seconds just like the Model 3, but the range is less about 280 miles. I heard that the Mach E is more comfortable and quieter, also I like that the Mach E has the speedometer right in front of the driver seat like every car other than a Tesla, so after watching many comparison videos I placed an order for a 2025 Mach E GT performance.",positive,positive
the fast charging now to 80% is 30-35 minutes,positive,positive
"You forgot to add that in 2024 the Ford Mustang Mach E will be able to charge at the Tesla level 3 chargers nationwide, lowering the charge time.",positive,positive
"I bought a Mach e. Two and a half years ago.  I have the extended range battery. BUT your numbers are wrong. It was 76,000 dollars. First, it’s a great car and I love it. It is extremely comfortable to sit in. It has all the features anyone could want. That said, charging at home is an overnight affair. I won’t use fast chargers because the charge you by TIME that you are hooked up. That makes it more expensive than gas. While the “frunk” is nice, I never use it. And that area remains unseated during snow. So snow builds up while you drive.  Using the one pedal drive causes your rotors to rust up from not being used. Then you switch back to normal drive and the pads and rust combine to destroy your rotors. I could go on and on about the poor features. But there’s no time here. So while I liked your presentation, you don’t have all the facts. You should dig deeper. I’ll end with this. EVs are not what they are cranked up to be. Before you buy one, DO YOUR HOMEWORK. LET THE BUYER BEWARE. Dealers won’t tell you the down sides. Politicians are pursuing an agenda. They LIE. Our nations electric grid cannot handle the load. Californians are already being told NOT to charge up at home. EVs are not ready for Prime Time. They only can last about 10 years, MAX. THEN YOU NEED TO REPLACE THE BATTERY. That costs, in my case, $37,000. A gas car can last 20 years or more with proper care. Not so for EVs. If people don’t buy them, manufacturers won’t make them. EVs are being pushed down our throats by lying, scheming politicians. That includes our “Resident.”",positive,positive
"Evs are a fad, just like they were 20, 30, 40, and even 50 years ago. They are nothing new and will not last as gas cars can last longer and drive longer distances. While they are good in theory, evs are more dangerous to the environment with lithium batteries . Which are more dangerous to the environment than gas and costs 3x as much to produce.  So you're not saving the environment, you're actually killing it x3.",neutral,neutral
"Yeah, in the top three requirements of my next BEV is a fast charge rate and flat curve.",positive,positive
I don't get why this is labeled as a mustang when its a 4 door crossover but it seems to be a decent EV. They should make one thats a 2 door coupe or convertible like mustangs have always been previously.,neutral,neutral
"Amazing looking car, had mine for 6 months nothing but amazing. People regularly compliment the looks.  I drove so many electric cars and i bought this one as soon as i sat in it. So many people seem to comment without actually owning or driving one.",positive,positive
Wow! Este episodio es para recordar! 👍⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,positive,positive
Bought my wife a Mach E GT and love it. When we travel long distances we use a gas vehicle but we hardly ever do. Had it for about 4 months and it drives and charges seamlessly.,positive,positive
"A big “pro” is that there are thousands of low mileage used ones for sale for under $30,000.  NEVER buy a new EV because they depreciate so rapidly.",neutral,neutral
THANK YOU!,neutral,neutral
I already have one n I love it more than any Tesla out there,positive,positive
"I'm a big fan of ford products. I currently own a '52 F3 flat bed truck w/flat head V8. a '65 Mustang 289 cinvertible,  a '67 F-100 352 short bed, a '70 Torino 351 convertible, an '04 Thunderbird convertible, a '17  Expedition, and a '22 Escape. I am among the many who dislike the direction Ford went with the Mach-E. As a Ford fan I amd disappointed with the overall quality of their EV's - especially their low charging rates and vehicle software integration. Worse, I detest the poor economics of Ford's EV manufacturing decisions which are bleeding the company dry economically. (They can't sell them for what it costs to make them!)

After waiting and waiting to purchase a new Ford as my first EV, I wound up buying a Tesla Model S (with which I am thoroughly satisfied.) C'mon Ford, get your EV act together!",negative,negative
Using the name Mustang for this overweight SUV/Crossover is still a travesty....,negative,negative
Honestly the zero to 60 nobody cares. It's not like I'm the red light... Ready set go!,positive,positive
This thing is a slap in the face to the Mustang. Which Is a powerful muscle car. Guaranteed 300 to 400 miles per tank and $40 to fill up in 5 minutes.,negative,negative
"Mustang= sports car, family limo or station wagon= family car.
Any questions children?",neutral,neutral
People wich one its better ? Tesla or that one ?,neutral,positive
