"I have an iphone 6, and today I noticed that it is slightly bended.
I feel betrayed by Apple and there seemingly ""Quality"".

In response to the people that say the bending of my phone is my own fault, this is the only thing I have to say:

If I buy something of this ""Quality"" there should not be an risk of getting damaged under normal use. If people would blame me for bending my phone, they might as well blame me for getting struck by lightning because I was walking outside of the protection of my house...",neutral,neutral

"This did not happen if you immediately put your phone into an OtterBox defender case, life proof FRE, or any other hard shell poly carbonate case with or without a TPU layer. It’s only happened to folks who used those very flexible silicone cheap cases knock off brands or carry them bareback. The 6000 series aluminum that Apple used in the iPhone 6 and 6+ was the main culprit. This never happened again as soon as Apple upgraded to a 7000 series aluminum which debuted in the iPhone 6s series",neutral,neutral
