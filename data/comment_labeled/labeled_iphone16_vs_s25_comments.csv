"I switched from the Apple ecosystem to Samsung.  I was having issues with car play dropping and issues with connecting.  My daughter is having the same issues. Now that I am with Samsung and Android I have never had an issue.  I now have the Samsung watch and S10 + tablet and all work together seamlessly. Plus once my S25 Ultra, everything set itself up and I haven't had any issues at all.  My Apple 15pro max and iPad pro M4 13"" didn't sync,especially with emails and messages. I will never go back to Apple. Once with Apple you are stuck with it. There is so much more flexibility with Android.",positive,positive
I carry both these phones…I am deep in the IPhone ecosystem but the Samsung phone is clearly a better faster phone that can take excellent photos…..IPhone is left in the dust by samsung,positive,positive
Neither.,negative,negative
"I don't understand why the youtubers compare iphones and androids. Iphones don't sell their phones they sell ios and their insane cameras that shoot amazing videos. See this comparison is pointless the s25 ultra will beat iphone 16 pro in all the areas specification wise. But iphone users don't see that in iphones. It's really important to understand that. Yes on paper the s25 ultra is a better phone but there are other aspects where iphone beats the s25 ultra. And I'm not saying that in those areas the s25 ultra can't do well but there are some things that the iphone just does better. Why do you think all the celebrities, most content creators and most filmmakers have an iPhone that's because iphones just do social media better its more optimized. Videos on the iphones are really nice. And not to mention their phones running on ios is just a different experience all together. Yes for me if I were to pick between one of them then I will go for the s25 ultra but if I was heavy on social media and videography or had a lot of followers on Instagram I will close my eyes and go for the iphone.",positive,positive
Here I am with my pixel 7 and hating how far behind Google is on smartphones.,positive,positive
"I believe your assessment is largely accurate. However, a crucial category you might have overlooked is service and repair. For instance, I can get an Apple device serviced in about an hour. I’m not certain if Samsung can match this level of service. Nevertheless, if the Chinese continue to improve at their current pace, both Samsung and Apple could potentially lose their positions on the world stage.",neutral,neutral
"As a long time iPhone user, I’m planning on switching to the Pixel line when the 10 releases. I’ve owned the Pixel 2XL and it was awesome! I did briefly consider the Samsung line but I just can’t get past One UI and the bloatware.",neutral,neutral

"Are you serious right now?
Samsung and Android have have the top row down quick settings menu for a very long time ever used to have the quick settings menu from the downside and up into the assistant Apple can even half of Gemini can do",positive,positive
"I have.
 An iPhone 15 promax and  the S23 Ultra. Honestly samsung is better when it comes to tuning the animations to your liking customization with themes and keyboards. And has an amazing 200 megapixel camera. Also a great selfie camera. Iphone on the other hand is better in the sense that when you use it, it just works really well and you don't have to do nothing. Animations of battery smove opening the closing apps are buttery smooth. I love dynamic island. And I also like that when you Check-in notifications and you swipe from the left down. It takes you to the lock screen with Siri. Yes, I have a nice lock screen wallpaper while checking notifications. Well on Samsung, it's pretty basic though you could make it transparent for there'snow background. Battery life is amwzing on both ill stick with both lol idc two phones for me it is!!!",positive,positive

"I’m beginning to doubt your credibility. 
The iPhone pro max is always heavier than the Samsung, so it’s not only this year where the Samsung is lighter. 

Besides, after your conclusion, you don’t have to tell us what you personally use. All those apple products you mention are not part of the iPhone. It’s a stand alone comparison between the two. Thank you.",positive,positive
Even before I see the last part of your video I knew you'r an iPhone'r.  I use both (with iPhone as main) and I know exactly how an iOS user looks at both.,neutral,neutral
"you know whatt....since theres so much of confusion so im gonna go for both of em and btw in india the samsung s25 ultra (rs. 1,29,000) and iphone 16 pro max (1,44,990) that is the iphone is more expensiv in india so it just depends on ur region for the prices............nicely done and appreciate ur work man.............ur review built up a lotta clarity for me.......keep up the good work",positive,positive

"I've had my 16 Pro max for 6-7 months now. Battery health is still 100% after 76 cycles. I have it at 80% charge and it lasts all day. Fastest chip on the market, never gets hot. Cameras are good and a very durable build. Extremely fast processing speed and apps are optimized. I have no complaints, this is the best iPhone ever made and I think it's way better than the s25 ultra considering the processing power, cooling capacity and overall how polished apps are on iOS.",positive,positive
The iSung Pro Ultra is the best,positive,positive
Couldn’t go wrong with either phones they’re both amazing I currently have 16 Pro Max. My girlfriend has the has 25 ultra ❤ she has had a few issues with it being slow after an update im not smart with Samsung another then that it’s definitely amazing 🙏  both great phones,neutral,neutral

I started with Iphone 4 all the way to Apple X then I decided to switch to Samsung because of 1 reason... planned obsolescence by Apple which I noticed way back when I have my IPhone 5 and I heard about it when I have my IPhone X,neutral,neutral
Ya no one likes the camera control button. I disabled it immediately. It ruined thousands of cases. I can’t stand it. I almost want to downgrade just so its not there.,negative,negative
"I moved to Samsung after 20 years as iPhone user.. and this should make Apple to wonder, since they are losing also alsto the loyal customers... and it is simple: Samsung is really much more ahead than Apple.. Apple arrives always late than Saumsung/Androind and the price they sell it is not fair anymore for what they really offer you... that's it",positive,positive
"Hello Sir … what would be your recommendation for long term use … S25 Ultra or, IPhone 16 Pro ???

Need your advice 🙏",neutral,neutral

You lost me at Siri being the winner. Show some transparency - you made this comparison because you have to fulfill that sponsorship didn’t you?,negative,negative
Thorough video though seems a bit slanted. I'm sticking with iPhone because the apps are much better and the app diversity is too.,positive,positive
S25 ultra is better,positive,positive
Gemini's speed and voice recognition accuracy are still its biggest issues and no one's talking about em. Not even Google cares.,neutral,neutral
I like Samsung I've never had a iPhone bc it was always so expensive plus I don't use a lot of apple products so iphone comparability isn't necessary,positive,positive

S25 Ultra. Definitely.,positive,positive
Buy a camera for a camera not a smart phone camera because over processed photos yet taking pictures with a camera and going into every photo editing tool known to man to make it look good 🤣,positive,positive
"Im using s21 ultra and iPhone 16 pro max,but believe me my 4 years old samsung is way better then iPhone 16,areas like typing, dual screen, spen,Bluetooth connection to any device without compromising sound quality which iPhone reduces the sound quality if it's not connected to apple devices, and the fun is using free apps on android including Google storage for free,which apple wants you to pay for everything 😊",positive,positive

I have both and I like the S25 Ultra better. Only thing keeping me on iPhone imessage and Facetime.,positive,positive
easy choice. I love the S25. but I have Apple everything. So to go with My Asus ROG strix I have the S25 as my main phone with galaxy watch. and the iPhone pro max 16 as my secondary phone for my MacBook Pro 16 and IMac and iPad Pro and apple watch And I use both all day long. So why compare when you can use both.,positive,positive

"Just found your channel and I really like the ""6 months later"" review concept. But why do you look constipated in all of your thumbnails?",neutral,positive
To me it’s about preference. I switched to the 15 pro max after the atrocity that was the S22 ultra and now I have the 16pro max. I’ve never been more satisfied with a smart phone and I was a Samsung loyalist since 2009. I hated iPhone without ever having one. iPhone just work more consistently for me.,neutral,neutral
"I've switched since iP14promax and mostly Apple devices to the Samsung Eco system because I was bored with the iPhone, I still use a mac studio and macbook pro, but replaced my phone and tablet and watch for top of the line Samsung products. Instead of iCloud I use OneDrive and so far so good. Also syncs on my PC and laptop (iCloud could also do that though). Samsung phones are really good and oneUI destroys iOs for me now. First time ever since smartphones I switched to Android and not going back anytime soon (if ever). Also ordered a nice Samsung laptop because I like windows better than MacOS since W11.",positive,positive
josh is so cute 🥵 and he's also a swiftie 😍,positive,positive

"iPhone 16 pro max is what I’m using, and I feel secured in every aspect. I tried S24 Ultra, but I really am not secured and confident while using S24 ultra. I’m back to Apple iPhone  with 16 pro max.",neutral,neutral
"Spec wise the s25 ultra is better in every way but the iphone is so optimized that it'll be on par or just slightly slower than the s25 ultra. Also if we talk about gaming, iphone games I feel are more optimized. Also with the iphone you get a lot of other things that you don't get with the s25 ultra that is the best smart watch, seamless airpods connection with all its features, seamless connection between the iphone and MacBook. If you're a editor editing on a MacBook its a no brainer to be using an iPhone. So its all that when it comes to iphones and people's preference towards the phone. But yeah just solely talking about the phone no phone in the world comes close to the beast itself, the powerhouse and the ultimate phone yes ofcourse I'm talking about the s25 ultra😂😂",positive,positive
I can’t watch these sponsored fake review vids anymore!,negative,negative
"The way i choose between the 2, if i prefer to be more productive, i go with samsung s25 ultra. If i prefer more social media uploads, then i go with iphone 16 pm.",positive,positive
"Some nifty features are overlooked in this comparison. For example: very much useful AI, very efficient S-pen, very helpful Galaxy routine, Reverse charging and so on.......!!! Samsung made my life very easy TBH!",positive,positive
"Nothing compares to IOS. Most people are too dumb to understand design language and tiny details but everything about IOS is just perfection. 
They just get it, simple as that. 
Buy the phone you like, but Apple is just the kind of design language. And they don’t glue their camera rings on……",positive,positive
Android 16 desktop mode will be a full linux thing.,positive,positive
I agree with Siri being faster than gemini. I only use siri to make calls and it is faster. I’m more of an android guy but siri is significantly faster. I don’t know why no one on YouTube talks about this.,positive,positive
13:55 What am I seeing here? Nothing happens on the iPhone?,neutral,neutral
3:25 yeah because its super important that when I watch videos that the phone is I hold it at a angle and not directly in front of me.,positive,positive
"S25 Ultra overheating, camera lag, camera lenses ring popping off, removed Bluetooth from S Pen, short battery life, screen coating rubbing off and dull screen all well documented on Samsung Community website. Glad cancelled order and hope S26 Ultra does better! Samsung needs better Engineers in their phone division indeed!",positive,positive
"Queria poder ter os dois hehehe
I with have both! 😂✌️",neutral,neutral
"Samsung DOES have a much larger ecosystem of devices than you think. 'Smart Things' app can literally control everything in your house way better than Home Kit. You can have a Samsung laptop, headphone, tablet, and watch all working in 1 ecosystem. You can then connect to your Samsung TV and control all sorts of apps. Furthermore, you can also use Google TV which works seamlessly with Samsung. The point being if you bought into all of the Samsung devices, you can live an Apple-free life.",neutral,neutral

Just adding one more thing . No phone in the world comes close to the overall performance of the s25 ultra except for the oneplus 13 its actually a really close contender but still not better than the s25 ultra. Yeah its just that good can't do anything about it.,positive,positive

"iOS is not as good as Android in Quality of Life Features - Android just has so many more where even basic android phones has features that IOS doesn’t have such as back gestures, clipboard, notification history, different sound level options, no mentioning how many hours till alarm rings, notification history, makes pip for maps amongst others",positive,positive
