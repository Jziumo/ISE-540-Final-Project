"Mind you I am an enthusiast so I buy phones just because and for the latest tech, as a heavy Samsung user I've bought the iPhone 16 Pro Max at launch. Apple Intelligence drew me into it,  knowing that it would take time though.  But not as much time as needed in retrospect, and I have been running the beta builds. Unprecedented for Apple, having thus used it for 7 months and now testing out the Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Samsung/Google partnership (Gemini makes use of Bixby  in the background for phone tasks) it's clear to me they do offer currently the best AI assistant. Beats Siri + Apple Intelligence by a lot, it's not even close. To me that is where it's at,  phone hardware only goes so far - it's all about the software in 2025,  and AI is a big part of it.",positive,positive
Bro downplaying how good this camera is (especially with that recording at 4K60 9:38 being so smooth and beautiful) confuses me üòÇ. It has the best overall camera in a smartphone. The consistency is what makes it so great.,positive,positive

"Still using and loving my 13PM & 13pro, ive had them since launch both are in mint condition. Apple's hardware is so damn good. I had to upgrade my Samsung s22U to the s25U bcz it was a laggy mess. Apple isn't giving me enough reasons if any ti upgrade. Damnit Apple üòÇ of course it would be a major upgrade, i just can't justify it when my phone's are running so damn good!!",positive,positive

I switched over from android 3 1/2 years ago and I can‚Äôt tell you how many features I have taught to lifelong Apple simply because i tinker with every setting possible to see what happens.",neutral,neutral
Mr tech chap so handsome and charming. I have the s25 ultra and the iPhone 16 pro max. Apple Ai is half baked. I prefer using the s25 ultra.,positive,positive

"Brother , I am really confused about which phone I should buy . I watched your Iphone 16 pro max video as well but i don't understand which one is perfect for me . I prefer good video and picture camera ( zoom isn't that much important for me but the quality of the video and pictures is important ) . With a better selfie camera with less noise . Good processing phone with smooth performance and stability and Good OS .Video with Pictures like less noise and good color balance. Zoom isn't that much important for me as I already have Samsung s 23 ultra . Please I am waiting for your reply brother .",neutral,positive
"After buying a pixel 9 pro xl, i moved back after 4 weeks to the iphone 16 pro max‚Ä¶ google still needs to improve a lot of stuff specially in the camera department, photos are constantly blurry, lack detail specially when the subject is in movement, video quality is so bad thet you need to depend on an online service to make it ‚Äúbetter‚Äù‚Ä¶ it is just a bad phone. So here i am back to the iphone 16 pro max",positive,positive
"Last 6-7 iphones are looking the same - the same thing that happened with iphone 6-7-8 (with s models every other year). That‚Äôs 6 years of producing the same phone with 10% better chip or camera that noone really needs. Nobody on earth can tell me that 10% faster phone will make his life or work easier. But now, when they say it will change things with 17 (and still the changes are not ‚Äúhuuugeee‚Äù like some of youtubers are presenting), the prices will go up for basically the same phone. Jumping from 8 to X was ‚Äúhugeeee‚Äù. Jumping from 3s to 4 was ‚Äúhugeee‚Äù. But jumping from X to any of the models after - 11,12,13,14,15 or 16 - it‚Äôs just small things here and there, nothing major. Apple just have a good marketing. (The same thing applies to Samsung).",neutral,neutral
Still on my 13 pro max and about to replace the battery. The stainless steel design look so much better than the 16 pro max line up,negative,negative
My sons just gone from an iPhone 15 to a Xiaomi 14T Pro and have to say it‚Äôs way better in most ways plus you can set the camera up to use like the iPhone . All for ¬£500 . Think apples days are numbers in my household ‚Ä¶ they have become as boring as f1 üòÇ,neutral,neutral

"i switched to the 16 plus about a month ago after having the 13 for a year (as my first iphone) and i honestly think its about the same experience. i use the camera button a lot more than i thought i would but i dont use the ai ""features"". and those are like... the only memorable things i can even think about in my experience of using it.",positive,positive

Well i owned the 16pm from launch and lts me tell you the worst phone i ever had (apple) the 15pm was so much better for me at least the camera is a shit and buggy all the time i have to restart the camera app for some reason and audio quality sometimes takes a hit the typing is fking hard and not very responsive sometimes the phone is full of bugs here and there i swear to god i turned on my old iphone 13 now and um using it amd going to buy some top of the line android phone to try it s25 ultra or pixel9 pro woth that shity soc oh well im starting to hate iphones ngl,negative,negative

I bought 16prm literally 2 days ago upgraded from 14prm . I would say Inlove 14prm more than 16prm. the overheating is constantly making me regret upgrading. Just after 10 minutes of video calling the phone is super hot and 5-10 minutes of watching YouTube it‚Äôs again the same. Is it just my device or are they the same for y‚Äôall?,negative,positive

Correct.  Everyone is not a creator.  For those of us who aren't the 16 Pro Max is just a 15 Pro Max with an awkward-to-use and badly placed camera button and embarrassingly awful AI.,negative,negative
still rocking the 14 pro max and I don't think I'm missing out on a lot yet. Type c will be nice but apple intelligence is still trash (tried it on my ipad and mac),negative,negative
Great review il definitely upgrade to the 17 pro max range best wishes from Cheshire,positive,positive
"Had mine since launch, and if you look past the Apple Intelligence fiasco, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is hands down the best iPhone ive ever had, it's just a really good iPhone it does all the things you want it to do, excellently. Screen is amazing, speed is great battery is honestly a joke at times it's so good cameras are really good. if apple didn't promise the AI world this phone wouldn't be looked down upon so much.",positive,positive

"Ive moved on to android , at least to vivo x200 u 

Since the iphone x, 13 14 , 16 

The only thing that is great or two 

Is the like the mentioned is decent battery and efficiency 

Decent photos and video 

But overall is the backup icloud and restore and seamless transition between macbooks is ehy im still holding on 


But for daily use and video / photos, x200 ultra will be my main 

Apple dropped the ball on hardware ( apart from SoC ) 

Like the screen, and the camera sensor and lens, and the freaking wifi. For christ sake , i could understand camera and screen but effing WIFI !? üò¢",negative,negative

Moved up from iPhone 12 to 16 Pro max must say I was least excited about upgrade. Of course camera are better as is battery life but otherwise it is smallest upgrade for me and I‚Äôve been since 3GS days. Definitely keeping my phone for 2-3 years maybe even more.,positive,positive

"iPhone 13 Pro since March 2022‚úÖ.
Peak iPhone. Anything else is nothing special.
A better chip, a better camera, a better screen are normal things.
A new useless button is...non sense.

If it ain't broke, don't buy a new one.",positive,positive

"I'm disappointed with Apple I truly wish they didn't annoyance AI stuff at all. I think it was more about appeasing investors than customers because I don't think (everyday) people have been that pressed for AI on their phones.

P.S. my 15 pro has been solid BUT the processing does struggle more times than not.",neutral,neutral
You made this so easy to understand.,positive,positive
"As a tech reviewer I tend to not be biased, but let's call a rock, a rock here, Apple has seriously fallen behind and lost the plot. A year in tech is a lifetime, that's a long enough time to lose customer base, let other brands innovate and surpass Apple. One thing here, the Vivo X200 Pro has better video recording than the Iphones already, and it uses a log format that's easier to colour grade. Times are a changing, and it's not going to be kind to companies that cant keep up, or make promises they can't keep...",negative,negative

I kept my iPhone 15 Pro Max for another year. To add, for the last week I‚Äôve been testing the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and I‚Äôm mad a myself for becoming so dependent on the Apple ecosystem, because this phone blows out of the water every iPhone that has come out in the last 3 years.
