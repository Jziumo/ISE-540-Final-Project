"Great job by Allen, gave us the specs and the good and not so good aspects of the shoes. Thanks for another great video from Weartesters.",positive,positive
"Great review! The only thing I personally like about the GT Cut 2 is the insole. For me, GT Cut 1 has been the most perfect hoop shoe for my feet. But I do wish it had more cushion in the heel, since they've bottomed out pretty quick. With the GT Cut 2, when I cut hard, the upper material has no give so it's pretty painful for my feet (rip-stop kite material). The GT Cut 1 feels much better and comfortable all around. So I decided to swap insoles and put the GT Cut 2 insoles inside my GT Cut 1, I can't go back to anything else. It's the most perfect set-up for me. Too bad it takes 2 pairs to make my favorite pair.",positive,positive
Another great review from Allen. The weartesters are all doing great and providing very insightful reviews. Thank you.,positive,positive
The lacing system for GT cut 2 is horrible. It doesn't contain my heel and i feel like it's gonna slip out,negative,negative
"For me, comparing this with the Lebron 20s, I‚Äôd prefer the GT Cuts. For some reason, it‚Äôs super cushioned plus the drop-in midsole form makes my foot want to propel forward (and the comfort plus bounce is just crazy). Whereas with the LeBrons, it‚Äôs too low for me in my opinion then its cushlon midsole makes my foot sink in more.",neutral,neutral
Allen with another great review!!üíØüôè,positive,positive
Really solid review. 6:24 is a great piece of info to help with the tongue movement.,positive,positive
Been waiting on the performance review for these for a while.,neutral,neutral
"I returned my GT Cut 2s, imo they are so much worse the the 1s. Had heel slippage, heel traction felt nonexistent, and toes definitely kept getting jammed up. Best part of the 2s is the smear traction.",negative,negative
"Haha heck yeah, was literally thinking today, this exact video would be great right about now üòÇüëå",positive,positive
I think the GT cut 2‚Äôs look better imo,positive,positive
"I really liked this review, complete and straight to the point! Great job!",positive,positive
"just my opinion, the traction missing out in the mid section, so if you plant like what he did 2:00, you WOULD slideeeeee",neutral,neutral
Great extensive review. Think I would stick with the 1's,positive,positive
Excellent work on this! Can you please do performance review on the freak 4? üòÉ,positive,positive
"PLEASE tell me Allen is a Community fan. That scene with Donald Glover/Troy Barnes is so good!

I will definitely give these a chanceüëç",positive,positive
great review Allen,positive,positive
Well done Allen!,neutral,neutral
"I actually had a ton of traction issues with the 2. I had to return them  because I felt that the traction was pretty trash. I only played with them indoors, and I felt that the traction design and overall foot feel was too diff from the beloved Gt cut1s",positive,positive
Lockdown is terrible with this shoe. My left shoe came off during play even though I had them tied so tight I lost feeling in that same foot. If you‚Äôre considering these just buy the Lebron 20‚Äôs instead.,negative,negative
"Keep it up, appreciate the reviews üëç",neutral,positive
Another solid review!,neutral,positive
What about sizing? True to size is it ok?,positive,positive
is it normalnthat even tho i added 1+ size in the shoe my foot is literally touching the tip of the shoe,positive,positive
"Hi Allen, is that outdoor court in La Palma Ca?  Looks familiar to me.  Great review",positive,positive
I liked the 2s wish they had some better colorways tho I like my green pair the best but those PKI black and gold üî•,positive,positive
Awesome review Allen! Love these shoes,positive,positive
"Really prefer the GT Cut 1 look, but will try to get a pair of the 2s!",positive,positive
I sprained my ankle in the first time playing in these üò¢ but i still love them,positive,positive
i had to go up half a size. The traction is fantastic. There's a bit of heel slippage whether I wore my size or sized up. That was fixed by using a runner's lace lock technique. Then I blew out my calf.,positive,positive
They feel tight even tho I got the right size is that normal I barley got em,neutral,neutral
Bro you play at Central Park in la palma?! Lol,positive,positive
I feel like the tongue rings dig into my feet on my pair and it lowkey hurts. Also the heel slippage is pretty bad on these even when tied super tight with a runners not. I would pick a shoe like the lebron 20/nxxt over these any day of the week,negative,neutral
The get cut 2‚Äôs are comfy but I get really bad blisters from them,negative,negative
Man I recognize that court and I may have played in there before. SUPER dusty. I also have a pair of the GT Cut 2 and it grips great at that court.,positive,positive
I slipped a lot while I was doing crossover.This shoe's traction is bad at spinning or sideways even if it's in indoor hardwood courts.,negative,negative
"Are those gt cut 1,2,3 low or mid shoes?",neutral,neutral
"Mmm weight distribution? Balanced? Mm idk I would say it‚Äôs bottom heavy just by trying them on and simply looking at em. Won‚Äôt be much of a difference on court tho. Hopefully I can get some at clearance.

And rocking ankle braces all the time at your age? Hopefully not too much. Gotta allow your ankles to strengthen.. if anything I only wear them during highly competitive Rec league games. Otherwise don‚Äôt do it kids.",neutral,neutral
I really like the 2 but somehow my left insole feels like a bubble in the forefoot like it would pop any secone if I put more strength into it. Anyone has the problem too?,positive,positive
Would you be willing to do a review on those Zamst ankle braces?,neutral,positive
How was the sizing?,neutral,neutral
Most mid shoe I have ever put on walked around in them for 5 mins and returned them,positive,positive
