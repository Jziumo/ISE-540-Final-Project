This vs lebron 21,neutral,neutral
Glad Nike got this right,positive,positive
"I love the look of these, and the fact that they're not as narrow as the GT Cut 2. But that price.....$190 for these.....Seriously? Oh well, they just might be worth the money, we'll see. Thanks for another dope video from Weartesters!",positive,positive
"Me after these arrive: ""Damnit, Nightwing, look what you made me do!"" ü§£",neutral,neutral
"Your description sounds like ( and it Looks like) a copy of the Shockwave 5, but I'll give the my a try.  FYI though, Nike outsoles wear out way faster on outdoor courts..",neutral,neutral

"Hey WearTesters! Here's a new idea on how to keep this channel up and running and gain more subscribers: Start making videos on revisiting sneakers you've reviewed in the past or recently. I mean, another performance review after they've been used several times. It's for viewers to learn how basketball shoes perform in the long term or after they've been used many times! Not just SINGLE reviews after you tested them for a few games only or first time on-feet feeling. Basketball shoes perform differently after many uses.",neutral,positive
i really like basketball shoes that look and feel like running shoes like this series . for my style of play is ideal.when i seldom play outdoors for fun with kids wearing my running shoes is always more comfort and free but lacks of support and cushion.that gap is filled with the built of this bballshoe .if only this upper close to the toes area wasn't kind of square shape .it should have been one piece connected with the rest upper.very good design! not the price though! only on bargain to buy.these recycled synthetic materials are all crap to pay for 190 ! thanks for the presentation!,positive,positive
These were going to be on my wish list. Its been since the T mac Millennium since I copped anything for the court but another torn ACL retired me. I might still try to pick them up if they ever hit discount. But I'm sad I wouldn't be able to put these to their intended purpose,positive,neutral
should put zoom stroble on gt-cut 3,neutral,neutral
The sole is similar to the material used on Lebron 17‚Äôs. Picks up dust easily and need to be wiped every possession to have a proper grip. The sole is very grippy specially on clean squeaky courts.,positive,positive
"Can't wait to get them on court- the CUt 2 was an aterthought (and w/ the ankle slippage of that shoe demmed super dangerous), the cut 3 really has lot of potential. We shall see "" if you don't wipe your shoes, are. youreally a basketball player"" really got me.. LOL",positive,positive
"Def improvement over the 2, but at that price is it better then WOW all city 2",positive,positive
I‚Äôve been waiting on this review. Almost bought them on ID4shoes then I was like nah Nightwing hasn‚Äôt done the review yet. Lol,positive,positive
I love the first GT Cut amazing and beautiful shoe but this one is kind of weird or ugly,negative,negative
"Well, are you, bro!?! üòÖ@2:13",neutral,neutral
"Those look sexy fr. Think they‚Äôll have the same bounce sensation as the Jordan XXV low just softer. Judging from my Invincible run 3‚Äôs , that zoom X cannot be tamed even if you cage it in it‚Äôs hella bouncy and soft üëçüèø",positive,positive
Is the EP version wider?,neutral,neutral
Li-ning Sonic 9 similarities,neutral,neutral
"got mine today at outlet for $69. when i tried it on, whoooaahhh such a good feeling. im just a weekend warrior. so i really need a very good cushion shoes",positive,positive
Is the shoe mainly for indoor courts or can it be used for outdoor courts?,neutral,positive
What are your thoughts on putting in the move insoles?,neutral,neutral
Are these the EP version? That might explain the wider last?,neutral,neutral
Fission 9 review when?,neutral,neutral
killed this. great job.,positive,positive
Love the message on the hoodie! I‚Äôve been meaning to grab a GT Cut. Are these breathable? Will you do a comparison videos between these and the take down version?,neutral,positive
"just got my pair from a retailer today, it's very interesting how my first reaction was also "" damn these are fun"". The traction feels awesome, the rubber feels really sticky, and the heel to toe transition is impeccable, very smooth. However, I would say the court feel isn't that great comparing to the ja 1s, Kyrie's, and kobe's, cuz it feels a little high off ground. The cushioning feels new to me, it doesn't have the compressive feeling of a zoom unit, but rather feels soft. There's a visible grey pebax plate (or whatever it's called) under the rubber, and it allows you to have a quick explosive comeback when you do stuff like the rocker step. Overall, very interesting shoes! (ps. in my opinion, if you are buying the ep versions, you should go down half a size)",positive,positive
"I want to add these to  my rotation of basketball rotation these, Lebron 20, Kobe 4, and Serious Player only",positive,positive
"looks and seems with nice features, but only zoomX over air zoom is a no go  :(",neutral,neutral
I played in the GT Cut 3s for 6+ hours now and they attract a lot of dust. Playing basketball is super annoying if you have to wipe after every other play. Maybe solid rubber will be better? Idk has anyone had the same experience? Do they get better? Thinking about returning them already lol,negative,neutral
Any frame do we see the inner side of the shoe?,neutral,neutral
i'm in the market for a running shoe..last one i had was a the lunar back in 2018...what's the follow up to that shoe?,neutral,neutral
They look like Lebrons 21,neutral,neutral
They definitely look nice,positive,positive
"These give me the same feeling as the original crazylight boosts back in 2016- the cushioning compared to other hoop shoes is next level. Haven't been this excited about the introduction of new tech in a hoop shoe since then, and have not been disappointed!",neutral,neutral
"Chinese brand like Li-Ning & Anta already great at making basketball shoes with Supercritical midsole with carbon fiber plate, Nike is kinda late to do this",positive,positive
We don't wipe soles in PR. we just play in any court.,neutral,neutral
"At least where I play here in Brazil,we don't usually wipe the traction and it's very rare to see someone doing it too. And it's outdoors!",neutral,neutral
Look like lebrons,neutral,neutral

Those are fire üî•,neutral,neutral
Looking like a LeBron @ first glance,positive,positive
Seeing mixed initial impressions! Any date on US release?,neutral,neutral
Of all the reviews you were the first one to praise the ZoomX. Gives me hope.,positive,positive
I‚Äôve been saying this ever since I saw this. The shape of the midsole really reminds of me the Jordan Jumpman Hustle.,positive,positive
"Reminds me of the old Alpha Project, the line that kinda pioneered the way for the Hyperfuse line or something. The kicks that had the transparent heel counter. They came out around the time of the Ultraposites, Flightposite 3s, Hyperdunks and VCs Shox. I think Gary Payton wore them in LA",neutral,neutral
üëç,neutral,neutral
I bought these for my son but bummed they don‚Äôt have a shank. They fold in half so I‚Äôm not sure they will have much energy return.,neutral,neutral
@Weartesters do these feel high off the ground? or feel like there could be stability issues? I only ask because the heel looks high off the ground compared to the forefoot. thanks,positive,positive
why did those leak photos of a different shoe came out like a month ago..? they came out as GTcut 3s..,neutral,neutral
How would you compare this to any of the Kobe line? I‚Äôve been chasing the Kobe 5-6 feeling.,neutral,neutral

MIND BLOWNNN",neutral,neutral
The 2s look better to me,neutral,neutral
"My son has both GT Cut 3 and Academy.  He loves the Academy and is a great value but the GT Cuts 3 are in another level with comfort, cushioning and energy return.",positive,positive
"My comment would be, can they make 3/4 or high top versions like back in the day.",positive,positive
I agree that this should have been the successor to the first one appearance wise. The GT Cut 2 looks like it's from a branched timeline. üòÇ,positive,positive
Those are the same design as the sabrina one,neutral,neutral
I was just hoping that they don‚Äôt cage the zoom X foam because that‚Äôs the most comfortable Nike Foam,positive,positive

"Hello, I have a question about GT CUT 3. The models in the video are clear-outsole models, and there is a model called CNY as a commemorative of the Year of the Snake, which is a rubber outsole model with opaque outsole. Is there a big difference between that model and the regular model? I can't find a review of opaque models like CNY. üò≠ Please help me, everyone",neutral,neutral
"Bro, they don‚Äôt even look like a basketball shoe they look like a running shoeüòÇüòÇ",neutral,neutral
this should be on Nike By You. Imagine the colorways you can create,positive,positive

Thanks as always for the review! I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing more colorways / loving ZoomX these days!!,positive,positive
Can't wait for GT Jump 3.,neutral,neutral
ja 1 or gt cut 3 (which one better for their price?),positive,positive
Oooooh!!! Good to hear that they did this right‚Ä¶unlike the React launch with the superfly. I remember that nonsense. LOL. Really excited to see the performance review‚Ä¶..those look so dope! It kinda takes me back to early 2000 nike basketball where they were putting out crazy performance bangers!,positive,positive
"Maybe he already talked about it in another video (maybe he wants his privacy), but what‚Äôs up with Mr. Wing‚Äôs hip? I‚Äôve been missing his performance review videos for a while, but he can‚Äôt hoop anymore at all? Just wishing him good health (as a fellow aging hooper)",neutral,positive
"Hey Chris, just wanted to ask are you not able to play any at all anymore?",neutral,neutral

Pls review the gt cut 3 zoom 5 edition the jason kidd version. üôèüèº,neutral,neutral
these look great but if these don‚Äôt have some zoom air in the forefoot i might have to pass because between zoom in the fore foot and heel in the basketball models and the zoom infront zoomx everywhere in thier runners (the best set up imo) it‚Äôs just the best they offer. zoom air>>,neutral,positive
