"Nice review!  And agree!  Picked it up and use it with an X stand so it's more ""portable"".  I lug it to the back patio and practice so the dog can play outside.  I usually play a Steinway CG and I was stunned at how this little keyboard feels under my fingers. It sounds beautiful!  Our dog is happy too."	1	1
"My P225 just arrived today, and the speakers and the keys' soft yet authentic touch are fabulous!"	1	0
Excellent review. VRM technology was the game changer for me. I had a Yamaha P-60 that I just sold and now I own a P-225. Couldn't be happier with the sound and playability.	1	1
Wonderful simple and honest review that helped secure a decision. Thank you.	0	1

"For those concerned about speakers , believe , p225 sounds terrific, fp10 and pxs 1100 are like toys compared to p225 speakers. Iam not talking  about tone and quality of signal sounds each one has its qualities, but the speakers hands down. I tryed them yesterday"	1	0
Why does the P125 have a different E. piano on the website? Do those voices also exist in the P225 model?	0	0
"You're the first reviewer to talk about the sound vents I saw..... as a P125 owner, I found those front speakers to be a turn off for me vs P125 speaker placement as a hobbyist player...... could be a game changer for an eventual upgrade...to get the GFX sound engine...."	1	1
This instrument really sounds nice.  I wonder if it is a better choice than the DGX-670 which is a complicated beast.	1	0
Just bought one today!	0	0

"Great review of the 225. I've had a P-80 for years and love it. Headphones only, but sounds great with those. I just got a P-45, did not like the sound. It's not ""bad"" but sounds muddy in the lower register with chords, seems OK with single notes. That might be due to the lower polyphony.  I sent the P-45 back and will be ordering a P-225 which I think will be miles better sound wise.  BTW the key bed on the P-45 was fine, just the sound was not. Again it was not ""bad"" and probably fine for beginners."	0	1
Does it have 2-way audio where you can access sample libraries and play different sounds from them on the keyboard?	0	0
"This is not the first ""p series"" with resonance modeling. It's been in the p515 for years. P515 also has the CFX sound. P515 is much more expensive, though."	0	0
"I might have considered this due to the form factor, but I bought a Casio Privia in March and feel happy with how incredible it is for the price. 

I expect this will be a cosy success."	0	0
How many acoustic piano variations does it has?	0	0
"Why move the speaker to the back, as if there's no room at the top? I remember disassembling my Clavinova years ago. It was very empty, yet they put the speakers at the bottom!"	-1	0
haa... i guess on 7:42 he suppressed laughing as he seems having realized this white thing hanging on his Headphones ??	0	0
It looks and sounds stunning. Question: Can you 'layer' two sounds together eg; E-Piano and Vibraphone?	0	0
Do you have to have the console stand to use the pedals? Or could I just purchase an X stand and use the pedals with it that way?	0	0
"First time buyer; I'm really  impressed. Can the P225 be plugged into an external amplifier, and if so, how? Thanx for any reply. JP"	1	0
Do the rear facing speakers work ok when placed against a wall?	0	0
Does it have the same feature as the YDP 145 and only changes the structure?	0	0

The speaker placement reminds me of the P-255	0	0
"I heard P125 had some issues on midi velocity when it works as midi controller. Can you check how the velocity reaction is like on this model? Also, can you recommend any digital piano with a great velocity for delicate piano playing? Thank you so much!"	0	0

Is it possible to tune this down a half step?	0	0
Do you guys think the dgx 670 is better	0	0
"Have one, before you buy, carefully check  higher notes sound ( which are little bit annoying for all piano modes). I used to have older Yamaha, where it was more natural. I would not buy it again."	-1	0
"Can you combine tones such as Organ & Electric Piano? Piano & Strings? Are there any flutes, or harps? Is there more than 1 electric piano sounds? Is there an Oboe?"	0	0

"if the key action is similar to Casio PX-S7000, then it won't work for me. When my thumb and little fingers are on the black keys, and now my middle or ring finger needs to press on the black key softly, because it is so close to the felt area, I wasn't able to press down on the Casio PX-S7000 black keys"	0	0
"Please p221 (61 or 73 keys, battery powered version,) thank you??"	0	0

"If anyone has a p125 I'll trade my brand new p225 for it, I just like the layout of 125 better"	-1	0
I really wish they had put the same effort and upgrade to the P525 (their FLAGSHIP model) which is terrible!	0	0
		
Is this compatible with the Samsung Galaxy (Android) tablets?	0	0

"""A completely redesigned action to fit in a slimmer chassis"": which is not a good thing at all. In fact, it is very bad."	-1	0
"It is worse than korg, roland or kawai"	-1	0
