"Excellent review - you've touched on areas that more lengthy reviewers entirely missed. Well done. (For instance, you mentioned the lack of a honky-tonk piano voice, and you actually showed the panel where the  1/4"" headphone jacks are. I've seen spec sheets that erroneously claim the P225 only has one headphone jack.)",,
"Long ago, instead of buying a nice, new car, I bought a new Petrof concert grand.  I believe it was 7’6”.  After about five years of owning it, I was forced to sell it.  Nothing, nothing can replace the experience of that sound, except for another concert grand.  Twice I had guests over who were professional, famous pianists.  They played it while I walked around it.  That experience was incredible.",,
"Came across this on my home page, beautifully reviewed and yet underrated. Keep it up.",,
"4:13 i appreciate you showing the like and dislikes list toward the end. It was nice to have you ""spell"" them out and also go back over them.",,
"Interesting. Did you by any chance check the static pressure needed to move C4 (I need something around 50 g - GHS action and Yamaha C7 grand piano that I play have this static pressure needed to move the key and I will not tolerate even 60g because I got into some finger joint problems after playing on P-515 for ten months)   
Thank you. 
Michael
Ps. Yamaha Canada tells me that it will be available in November",,
I love this review. Simple and on point. I laughed at when you played with headphones😅,,
Was that “Würm” at 02:30 employed intentionally with the layering demonstration?,,
Great some one with real life review with what it sounds like in a room through the speakers.,,
Nice video helps a lot,,
Why is it so hard to find real reviews of digital pianos like this one? 99% of them are from stores. It's like people who buy these things never get around to playing them long enough to make a review.. sad.,,
"Is it possible to have variation for layering? If not, how do we know which two variations are combined?",,
Very useful video. Thank you!,,
Great info!  Thx😊,,
"3:20 ""not to be confused with the p-value that you have in college statistics""

that cracked me up 😂",,
"When you connected the p225 to the notebook via USB cable, the sound that came out on the piano speakers was from the virtual instrument of the notebook???",,
wonderful review 👍🫰👏🙌🫶👌,,
I had no idea that my piano can connect to the computer like that one plug thank you so much I needed to record in a DAW for a school project so I appreciate it,,
I just bought one and I love it!!,,
"When playing with headphones, how do you find the action noise - do you think it would be disruptive to housemates in another room?

Thanks for your review!",,
"It was very nice. Thank you, I appreciate this video",,
For me this 225 offers one really good piano sound and the other sounds i would almost never use. How much do you need to spend to get ten great piano sounds.,,
tysm! I am planning on buying this piano,,
Hi! Im getting my first digital piano.. do you recommend me this Yamaha p225 over the p125??,,
"I ordered this piano, I have heard there is a transpose feature on it but I would like to know how that works",,
"I am a beginner, should I get this piano, or get a more cheaper one that will last me longer until I get better?",,
"At volume slider fully to the left (lowest) is the piano completely silent? I’ve had audio issues with a prior yamaha p125 where the audio would fluctuate from extrmely quiet to loud while playing, so i bought the p225 recently. I’m still nervous about audio issues because of that and it just feels really quiet to me overall. I haven’t seen anywhere online if it should be completely silent or not when at lowest volume, so I was just wondering to make sure mine doesn’t have any audio issues. Any idea???",,
Can’t decide if I should get my son a Roland FP-10 or this Yamaha P-225?,,
What is you opinion on the key action? I'm between this one and the fp30x. People usually say the Roland has the closest to an acoustic piano.,,
"Can you use other speakers via one of the aux ports and/or Bluetooth 
Or are you limited to just headphones and the built in speakers?",,
Have you personally compared the Yamaha P-225 and the Kawai ES-120 side by side?,,
That’s how every review should be,,
"Was Nirvana ""Heart shaped box"" at the end of your video?",,
"When I first got the keyboard I thought it sounded amazing, however after some time with it I noticed it began to sound more and more digital and less acoustic. I don't know why but that initial tone has lost it's brilliance and it just sounds like a cheap keyboard now. I don't think it's broken or anything, I think I just used it so much that I can immediately tell it's just a fake digital imitation. Still, I play it every day, but what can I do to enhance the sound? I've tried all the settings, reverb, walleq, etc. Can a better sound be achieved via a midi cable and then using my own custom samples/synths within a DAW? I've not tried midi, but I suspect there will be a noticeable latency along with errors in transcription. In order to try it I will have to rearrange my furniture and it's going to be a rather big hassle, but if it is possible I will make it happen.",,
Dear Friend Rayat Ji How Are You Doing Today Your All Post Are Very Nice Changbhala Shivbanaresh Vande Jijau Ma Taram Dirgha Aausha Jagach Yuge yuge ..................Eshwar SHIVBANARESH allways 🧡 LOVE YOU 🧡 forevermore,,
Does it have a transpose feature?,,
Many thanks.,,
"I will only mention the cons. It seems that the number of function buttons has been reduced for design reasons, so it is somewhat inconvenient. It seems to sell well as an interior decoration. The speaker size is small, so the sound is not that good. I think it is to reduce the unit price. I recommend listening with headphones. There are not many drum patterns. There are no basic patterns, only complex patterns. You should not think that this product is the only best choice.",,
"So, i don't get it, what's missing?",,
Does it have a quarter tone feature for oriental music?,,
Is it possible to turn the sustain mode on as a setting? (So without using the pedal),,
What song was that when playing with headphones?,,
"Beautiful piano, I love piano.  Ok thanks.",,
I appreciate the review. Bless you and your loved ones in Jesus’ Name.,,
How many rhythms are there.,,
Does this have a Guzheng instrument voice?,,
"Haha greag review.. Only a nerd would say "" Let the P from Yamaha not confuse you with P value of statistics.""

Happy learning, folks 😀",,
You need to buy a keyboard stand and a keyboard player chair ... If you play like what youre doing here youre gonna develop some bad habbits...,,
It sounds like a Yes fan,,
I THOUGHT THE PEDAL WAS PLAYED UPSIDE DOWN NOT LIKE THAT xddd,,
Don't understand why you need a cable instead of Bluetooth.,,
😮🎉😅,,
