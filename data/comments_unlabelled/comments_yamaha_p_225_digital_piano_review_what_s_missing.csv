"3:20 ""not to be confused with the p-value that you have in college statistics""

that cracked me up 😂"		
Does it have a transpose feature?		
I am a beginner, should I get this piano, or get a more cheaper one that will last me longer until I get better?

I appreciate the review. Bless you and your loved ones in Jesus’ Name.		
Does it have a quarter tone feature for oriental music?		
wonderful review 👍🫰👏🙌🫶👌		
Have you personally compared the Yamaha P-225 and the Kawai ES-120 side by side?		
For me this 225 offers one really good piano sound and the other sounds i would almost never use. How much do you need to spend to get ten great piano sounds.		
"Can you use other speakers via one of the aux ports and/or Bluetooth 
Or are you limited to just headphones and the built in speakers?"		
Long ago, instead of buying a nice, new car, I bought a new Petrof concert grand.  I believe it was 7’6”.  After about five years of owning it, I was forced to sell it.  Nothing, nothing can replace the experience of that sound, except for another concert grand.  Twice I had guests over who were professional, famous pianists.  They played it while I walked around it.  That experience was incredible.		
😮🎉😅		
It sounds like a Yes fan
